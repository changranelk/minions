Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 3 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[Union[str, List[str]]]\n    answer: Optional[Union[str, List[str]]]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    """\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

Research, development and related expenses totaled $1.763 billion in 2015, $1.770 billion in 2014 and $1.715 billion in 2013.\nResearch and development, covering basic scientific research and the application of scientific advances in the development of new and\nimproved products and their uses, totaled $1.223 billion in 2015, $1.193 billion in 2014 and $1.150 billion in 2013. Related expenses\nprimarily include technical support; internally developed patent costs, which include costs and fees incurred to prepare, file, secure and\nmaintain patents; amortization of externally acquired patents and externally acquired in-process research and development; and gains/losses\nassociated with certain corporate approved investments in R&D-related ventures, such as equity method effects and impairments.\n \nThe Company’s products are sold around the world under various trademarks. The Company also owns, or holds licenses to use, numerous\nU.S. and foreign patents. The Company’s research and development activities generate a steady stream of inventions that are covered by\nnew patents. Patents applicable to specific products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or patent\ngrant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent,\nwhich can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in\nthe country.\n \nThe Company believes that its patents provide an important competitive advantage in many of its businesses. In general, no single patent or\ngroup of related patents is in itself essential to the Company as a whole or to any of the Company’s business segments. The importance of\npatents in the Electronics and Energy segment is described in “Performance by Business Segment” — “Electronics and Energy Business” in\nPart II, Item 7, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n \nRaw Materials\n \nIn 2015, the Company experienced declining costs for most raw material categories and transportation fuel, due largely to the significant\nprice decreases in crude oil. This in turn drove year-on-year cost decreases in many feedstock categories, including petroleum based\nmaterials, minerals, metals and wood pulp based products. To date, the Company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to\nmeet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements. It is impossible to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such\nshortages would have. 3M has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of existing raw material\ninventories and development and qualification of additional supply sources. 3M manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply\ncontracts, price protection agreements and forward contracts.\n \nEnvironmental Law Compliance\n \n3M’s manufacturing operations are affected by national, state and local environmental laws around the world. 3M has made, and plans to\ncontinue making, necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable laws. 3M is also involved in remediation actions relating to\nenvironmental matters from past operations at certain sites (refer to “Environmental Matters and Litigation” in Note 14, Commitments and\nContingencies).\n \nEnvironmental expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are\nexpensed. Reserves for liabilities for anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and\nreasonably estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies, the Company’s commitment to a plan of action, or\napproval by regulatory agencies. Environmental expenditures for capital\n6\n \nTable of Contents \nprojects that contribute to current or future operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.\n \nIn 2015, 3M expended about $26 million for capital projects related to protecting the environment. This amount excludes expenditures for\nremediation actions relating to existing matters caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues, which are\nexpensed. Capital expenditures for environmental purposes have included pollution control devices — such as wastewater treatment plant\nimprovements, scrubbers, containment structures, solvent recovery units and thermal oxidizers — at new and existing facilities constructed\nor upgraded in the normal course of business. Consistent with the Company’s emphasis on environmental responsibility, capital\nexpenditures (other than for remediation projects) for known projects are presently expected to be about $51 million over the next two years\nfor new or expanded programs to build facilities or modify manufacturing processes to minimize waste and reduce emissions.\n \nWhile the Company cannot predict with certainty the future costs of such cleanup activities, capital expenditures or operating costs for\nenvironmental compliance, the Company does not believe they will have a material effect on its capital expenditures, earnings or\ncompetitive position.\n \nExecutive Officers\n \nFollowing is a list of the executive officers of 3M, and their age, present position, the year elected to their present position and other\npositions they have held during the past five years. No family relationships exist among any of the executive officers named, nor is there\nany undisclosed arrangement or understanding pursuant to which any person was selected as an officer.

Research, development and related expenses totaled $1.763 billion in 2015, $1.770 billion in 2014 and $1.715 billion in 2013.\nResearch and development, covering basic scientific research and the application of scientific advances in the development of new and\nimproved products and their uses, totaled $1.223 billion in 2015, $1.193 billion in 2014 and $1.150 billion in 2013. Related expenses\nprimarily include technical support; internally developed patent costs, which include costs and fees incurred to prepare, file, secure and\nmaintain patents; amortization of externally acquired patents and externally acquired in-process research and development; and gains/losses\nassociated with certain corporate approved investments in R&D-related ventures, such as equity method effects and impairments.\n \nThe Company’s products are sold around the world under various trademarks. The Company also owns, or holds licenses to use, numerous\nU.S. and foreign patents. The Company’s research and development activities generate a steady stream of inventions that are covered by\nnew patents. Patents applicable to specific products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or patent\ngrant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent,\nwhich can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in\nthe country.\n \nThe Company believes that its patents provide an important competitive advantage in many of its businesses. In general, no single patent or\ngroup of related patents is in itself essential to the Company as a whole or to any of the Company’s business segments. The importance of\npatents in the Electronics and Energy segment is described in “Performance by Business Segment” — “Electronics and Energy Business” in\nPart II, Item 7, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n \nRaw Materials\n \nIn 2015, the Company experienced declining costs for most raw material categories and transportation fuel, due largely to the significant\nprice decreases in crude oil. This in turn drove year-on-year cost decreases in many feedstock categories, including petroleum based\nmaterials, minerals, metals and wood pulp based products. To date, the Company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to\nmeet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements. It is impossible to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such\nshortages would have. 3M has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of existing raw material\ninventories and development and qualification of additional supply sources. 3M manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply\ncontracts, price protection agreements and forward contracts.\n \nEnvironmental Law Compliance\n \n3M’s manufacturing operations are affected by national, state and local environmental laws around the world. 3M has made, and plans to\ncontinue making, necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable laws. 3M is also involved in remediation actions relating to\nenvironmental matters from past operations at certain sites (refer to “Environmental Matters and Litigation” in Note 14, Commitments and\nContingencies).\n \nEnvironmental expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are\nexpensed. Reserves for liabilities for anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and\nreasonably estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies, the Company’s commitment to a plan of action, or\napproval by regulatory agencies. Environmental expenditures for capital\n6\n \nTable of Contents \nprojects that contribute to current or future operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.\n \nIn 2015, 3M expended about $26 million for capital projects related to protecting the environment. This amount excludes expenditures for\nremediation actions relating to existing matters caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues, which are\nexpensed. Capital expenditures for environmental purposes have included pollution control devices — such as wastewater treatment plant\nimprovements, scrubbers, containment structures, solvent recovery units and thermal oxidizers — at new and existing facilities constructed\nor upgraded in the normal course of business. Consistent with the Company’s emphasis on environmental responsibility, capital\nexpenditures (other than for remediation projects) for known projects are presently expected to be about $51 million over the next two years\nfor new or expanded programs to build facilities or modify manufacturing processes to minimize waste and reduce emissions.\n \nWhile the Company cannot predict with certainty the future costs of such cleanup activities, capital expenditures or operating costs for\nenvironmental compliance, the Company does not believe they will have a material effect on its capital expenditures, earnings or\ncompetitive position.\n \nExecutive Officers\n \nFollowing is a list of the executive officers of 3M, and their age, present position, the year elected to their present position and other\npositions they have held during the past five years. No family relationships exist among any of the executive officers named, nor is there\nany undisclosed arrangement or understanding pursuant to which any person was selected as an officer.

The Company may\nalso make forward-looking statements in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in materials delivered to\nshareholders and in press releases. In addition, the Company’s representatives may from time to time make oral forward-looking statements.\n \nForward-looking statements relate to future events and typically address the Company’s expected future business and financial performance.\nWords such as “plan,” “expect,” “aim,” “believe,” “project,” “target,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “estimate,” “will,” “should,” “could,”\n“forecast”  and other words and terms of similar meaning, typically identify such forward-looking statements. In particular, these include,\namong others, statements relating to:\n·\nthe Company’s strategy for growth, future revenues, earnings, cash flow, uses of cash and other measures of financial\nperformance, and market position,\n·\nworldwide economic and capital markets conditions, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, financial conditions\nof our suppliers and customers, and natural and other disasters or climate change affecting the operations of the Company or our\nsuppliers and customers,\n·\nnew business opportunities, product development, and future performance or results of current or anticipated products,\n·\nthe scope, nature or impact of acquisition, strategic alliance and divestiture activities,\n·\nthe outcome of contingencies, such as legal and regulatory proceedings,\n·\nfuture levels of indebtedness, common stock repurchases and capital spending,\n·\nfuture availability of and access to credit markets,\n·\npension and postretirement obligation assumptions and future contributions,\n·\nasset impairments,\n·\ntax liabilities,\n·\ninformation technology security, and\n·\nthe effects of changes in tax, environmental and other laws and regulations in the United States and other countries in which we\noperate.\n \nThe Company assumes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements.\n \nForward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events and trends that are subject to risks and\nuncertainties. Actual future results and trends may differ materially from historical results or those reflected in any such forward-looking\nstatements depending on a variety of factors. Important information as to these factors can be found in this document, including, among\nothers, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” under the headings of “Overview,”\n“Financial Condition and Liquidity” and annually in “Critical Accounting Estimates.”  Discussion of these factors is incorporated by\nreference from Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of this document, and should be considered an integral part of Part II, Item 7,\n“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” For additional information concerning factors\nthat may cause actual results to vary materially from those stated in the forward-looking statements, see our reports on Form 10-K, 10-Q\nand 8-K filed with the SEC from time to time.\n \nItem 1A. Risk Factor s.\n \nProvided below is a cautionary discussion of what we believe to be the most important risk factors applicable to the Company. Discussion\nof these factors is incorporated by reference into and considered an integral part of Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nof Financial Conditions and Results of Operations.”\n \n* Results are impacted by the effects of, and changes in, worldwide economic, political, and capital markets conditions. The Company\noperates in more than 70 countries and derives approximately 60 percent of its revenues from outside the United States. The Company’s\nbusiness is subject to global competition and geopolitical risks and may be adversely affected by factors in the United States and other\ncountries that are beyond its control, such as slower economic growth, disruptions in financial markets, economic downturns in the form of\neither contained or widespread recessionary\n9\n \nTable of Contents \nconditions, inflation, elevated unemployment levels, sluggish or uneven recovery, government deficit reduction and other austerity measures\nin specific countries or regions, or in the various industries in which the Company operates; social, political or labor conditions in specific\ncountries or regions; natural and other disasters or climate change affecting the operations of the Company or its customers and suppliers; or\nadverse changes in the availability and cost of capital, interest rates, tax rates, tax laws, or exchange control, ability to expatriate earnings\nand other regulations in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates.\n \n* Change in the Company’s credit ratings could increase cost of funding. The Company’s credit ratings are important to 3M’s cost of\ncapital. The major rating agencies routinely evaluate the Company’s credit profile and assign debt ratings to 3M. The Company has an AA-\ncredit rating, with a stable outlook, from Standard & Poor’s and an Aa3 credit rating, with a negative outlook, from Moody’s Investors\nService. This evaluation is based on a number of factors, which include financial strength, business and financial risk, as well as\ntransparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting. The Company’s credit ratings have served to lower 3M’s borrowing\ncosts and facilitate access to a variety of lenders. The Company’s ongoing transition to a more optimized capital structure, financed with\nadditional low-cost debt, could impact 3M’s credit rating in the future. Failure to maintain strong investment grade ratings would adversely\naffect the Company’s cost of funding and could adversely affect liquidity and access to capital markets.\n \n* The Company’s results are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences. Demand for the Company’s products, which\nimpacts revenue and profit margins, is affected by (i) the development and timing of the introduction of competitive products; (ii) the\nCompany’s response to downward pricing to stay competitive; (iii) changes in customer order patterns, such as changes in the levels of\ninventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases which may be affected by announced price changes, changes in\nthe Company’s incentive programs, or the customer’s ability to achieve incentive goals; and (iv) changes in customers’ preferences for our\nproducts, including the success of products offered by our competitors, and changes in customer designs for their products that can affect the\ndemand for some of the Company’s products.\n \n* Foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the Company’s ability to realize projected growth rates in its\nsales and earnings. Because the Company’s financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars and approximately 60 percent of the\nCompany’s revenues are derived from outside the United States, the Company’s results of operations and its ability to realize projected\ngrowth rates in sales and earnings could be adversely affected if the U.S. dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies.\n \n* The Company’s growth objectives are largely dependent on the timing and market acceptance of its new product offerings, including its\nability to continually renew its pipeline of new products and to bring those products to market. This ability may be adversely affected by\ndifficulties or delays in product development, such as the inability to identify viable new products, obtain adequate intellectual property\nprotection, or gain market acceptance of new products. There are no guarantees that new products will prove to be commercially successful.\n \n* The Company’s future results are subject to fluctuations in the costs and availability of purchased components, compounds, raw materials\nand energy, including oil and natural gas and their derivatives, due to shortages, increased demand, supply interruptions, currency\nexchange risks, natural disasters and other factors. The Company depends on various components, compounds, raw materials, and energy\n(including oil and natural gas and their derivatives) supplied by others for the manufacturing of its products. It is possible that any of its\nsupplier relationships could be interrupted due to natural and other disasters and other events, or be terminated in the future. Any sustained\ninterruption in the Company’s receipt of adequate supplies could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, while the\nCompany has a process to minimize volatility in component and material pricing, no assurance can be given that the Company will be able\nto successfully manage price fluctuations or that future price fluctuations or shortages will not have a material adverse effect on the\nCompany.\n \n* Acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures, and other unusual events resulting from portfolio management actions and other evolving\nb\n\n--------------------------------\nAnd here is your task:\n\nExtract the exact figure (in millions) for \'Total Revenue\' or \'Net Sales\' for the year 2014.

The Company monitors its business portfolio and\norganizational structure and has made and may continue to make acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures and changes to its\norganizational structure. With respect to acquisitions,\n10\n \nTable of Contents \nfuture results will be affected by the Company’s ability to integrate acquired businesses quickly and obtain the anticipated synergies.\n \n* The Company’s future results may be affected if the Company generates fewer productivity improvements than estimated. The Company\nutilizes various tools, such as Lean Six Sigma, and engages in ongoing global business transformation. Business transformation is defined\nas changes in processes and internal/external service delivery across 3M to move to more efficient business models to improve operational\nefficiency and productivity, while allowing 3M to serve customers with greater speed and efficiency. This is enabled by the ongoing multi-\nyear phased implementation of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system on a worldwide basis. There can be no assurance that all of the\nprojected productivity improvements will be realized.\n \n* The Company employs information technology systems to support its business, including ongoing phased implementation of an ERP\nsystem as part of business transformation on a worldwide basis over the next several years. Security breaches and other disruptions to the\nCompany’s information technology infrastructure could interfere with the Company’s operations, compromise information belonging to the\nCompany and its customers,  suppliers, and employees, exposing the Company to liability which could adversely impact the Company’s\nbusiness and reputation. In the ordinary course of business, the Company relies on information technology networks and systems, some of\nwhich are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business\nprocesses and activities. Additionally, the Company collects and stores certain data, including proprietary business information, and may\nhave access to confidential or personal information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and\ncustomer-imposed controls. Despite our cybersecurity measures (including employee and third-party training, monitoring of networks and\nsystems, and maintenance of backup and protective systems) which are continuously reviewed and upgraded, the Company’s information\ntechnology networks and infrastructure may still be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attack by hackers or breaches,\nemployee error or malfeasance, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures, service providers\nincluding cloud services, natural disasters or other catastrophic events. It is possible for such vulnerabilities to remain undetected for an\nextended period, up to and including several years. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of threats\nto the Company’s information technology networks and infrastructure, none of them to date has had a material impact to the Company.\nThere may be other challenges and risks as the Company upgrades and standardizes its ERP system on a worldwide basis. Any such events\ncould result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or penalties under privacy laws, disruption in operations, and damage to the Company’s\nreputation, which could adversely affect the Company’s business. Although the Company maintains insurance coverage for various\ncybersecurity risks, there can be no guarantee that all costs or losses incurred will be fully insured.\n \n* The Company\'s defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely impact our\nresults. The performance of financial markets and discount rates impact the Company\'s funding obligations under its defined benefit plans.\nSignificant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets, and relevant\nlegislative or regulatory changes relating to defined benefit plan funding may increase the Company\'s funding obligations and adversely\nimpact its results of operations and cash flows.\n \n* The Company’s future results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings and legal compliance risks, including those\ninvolving product liability, antitrust, intellectual property, environmental, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery,\nanti-corruption, or other matters. The outcome of these legal proceedings may differ from the Company’s expectations because the\noutcomes of litigation, including regulatory matters, are often difficult to reliably predict. Various factors or developments can lead the\nCompany to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable, or make such estimates for matters\npreviously not susceptible of reasonable estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment, a significant settlement, significant\nregulatory developments or changes in applicable law. A future adverse ruling, settlement or unfavorable development could result in future\ncharges that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations or cash flows in any particular period.

Management’s  Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is designed to provide a reader of 3M’s\nfinancial statements with a narrative from the perspective of management. 3M’s MD&A is presented in eight sections:\n \n·\nOverview\n·\nResults of Operations\n·\nPerformance by Business Segment\n·\nPerformance by Geographic Area\n·\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n·\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\n·\nFinancial Condition and Liquidity\n·\nFinancial Instruments\n \nForward-looking statements in Item 7 may involve risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from those projected\n(refer to the section entitled “Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results” in Item 1 and the risk factors provided\nin Item 1A for discussion of these risks and uncertainties).\n \nOVERVIEW\n \n3M is a diversified global manufacturer, technology innovator and marketer of a wide variety of products and services. As described in Note\n16,  effective in the third quarter of 2015, within the Health Care business segment, the Company formed the Oral Care Solutions Division,\nwhich combined the former 3M ESPE and 3M Unitek divisions. 3M manages its operations in five operating business segments: Industrial;\nSafety and Graphics; Health Care; Electronics and Energy; and Consumer. From a geographic perspective, any references to EMEA refer to\nEurope, Middle East and Africa on a combined basis.\n \nRestructuring actions:\n \nDuring the fourth quarter of 2015, management approved and committed to undertake certain restructuring actions primarily focused on\nstructural overhead, largely in the U.S., and slower-growing markets, with particular emphasis on EMEA and Latin America. This impacted\napproximately 1,700 positions worldwide and resulted in a fourth-quarter 2015 pre-tax charge of $114 million, $88 million after-tax or\n$0.14 per diluted share.\n \nEarnings per share attributable to 3M common shareholders – diluted:\n \nThe following table provides the increase (decrease) in diluted earnings per share for 2015 compared to 2014, and 2014 compared to 2013.\n \n    \nYear ended \n \n \n \nDecember 31,\n \n(Earnings per diluted share)\n    \n2015\n \n2014\n \nSame period last year\n \n$\n7.49  $\n6.72  \nIncrease/(decrease) in earnings per share - diluted, due to:\n \n  \n   \n \nOperational benefits\n \n \n0.40   \n0.66  \nRestructuring charges\n \n \n(0.14)  \n —  \nAcquisitions and divestitures\n \n \n(0.02)  \n —  \nForeign exchange impacts\n \n \n(0.43)  \n(0.15) \nIncome tax rate\n \n \n —   \n(0.08) \nShares of common stock outstanding\n \n \n0.28   \n0.34  \nCurrent period\n \n$\n7.58  $\n7.49  \n16\n \nTable of Contents \nFor total year 2015, net income attributable to 3M was $4.833 billion, or $7.58 per diluted share, compared to $4.956 billion, or $7.49 per\ndiluted share, in 2014, an increase of 1.2 percent on a per diluted share basis. Operational benefits include the combination of selling price\nincreases and raw material cost decreases, partially offset by higher pension/postretirement benefit costs. Restructuring actions (discussed\nabove) resulted in an after-tax charge of 14 cents per diluted share. Acquisition and divestiture impacts primarily relate to the Capital Safety\nand Polypore Separations Media acquisitions, and the divestitures of the license plate converting business in France and substantially all of\nthe library systems business. Foreign exchange impacts decreased earnings per diluted share by approximately 43 cents year-on-year, driven\nby average year-on-year changes in foreign exchange rates in the Euro of 17 percent, Yen of 12 percent, and Brazil Real of 30 percent. The\nincome tax rate was largely unchanged year-on-year. Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding in 2015 declined 3.7 percent year-on-year\nto 637.2 million, which increased earnings per diluted share by approximately 28 cents. Refer to the section entitled “Results of Operations”\nfor further discussion.\n \nFor total year 2014, net income attributable to 3M was $4.956 billion, or $7.49 per diluted share, compared to $4.659 billion, or $6.72 per\ndiluted share, in 2013, an increase of 11.5 percent on a per diluted share basis. Operational benefits include a significant benefit from the\ncombination of selling price increases and raw material cost decreases, plus profit leverage on organic volume growth. Foreign exchange\nimpacts decreased earnings per diluted share by approximately 15 cents per diluted share. The income tax rate was 28.9 percent in 2014, up\n0.8 percentage points versus 2013, which decreased earnings per diluted share by approximately 8 cents. Weighted-average diluted shares\noutstanding in 2014 declined 4.6 percent year-on-year to 662.0 million, which increased earnings per diluted share by approximately 34\ncents.\n \nFourth-quarter 2015 sales and operating income results: \n \nFourth-quarter 2015 net income attributable to 3M was $1.038 billion, or $1.66 per diluted share, compared to $1.179 billion, or $1.81 per\ndiluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2014. Fourth-quarter 2015 sales totaled $7.3 billion, a decrease of 5.4 percent from the fourth quarter\nof 2014. 3M achieved organic local-currency sales growth (which includes organic volume and selling price impacts) in Health Care, and\nConsumer, with declines in Industrial, Safety and Graphics, and Electronics and Energy. Organic local-currency sales increased 4.5 percent\nin Health Care, led by health information systems, food safety, oral care, drug delivery systems, and critical and chronic care. Organic local-\ncurrency sales increased 2.7 percent in the Consumer business segment, with positive growth in the construction and home improvement\nbusiness, stationery and office supplies, and home care, while consumer health care declined. Organic local-currency sales declined 1.8\npercent in Industrial, with sales growth in 3M purification and automotive OEM more than offset by declines in industrial adhesives and\ntapes, abrasives, and advanced materials. Organic local-currency sales declined 2.5 percent in Safety and Graphics, with sales declines in\npersonal safety partially offset by sales growth in roofing granules, and commercial solutions, while traffic safety and security was flat.\nElectronics and Energy organic local-currency sales growth declined 7.7 percent, with decreases in electronic-related sales in both\nelectronics materials solutions, and display materials and systems. Energy-related organic local-currency sales declined in renewable energy,\ncommunications markets, and electrical markets.

Organic local-currency\nsales declined 0.4 percent in the United States, 0.6 percent in Latin America/Canada, and 2.7 percent in Asia Pacific. In EMEA, Central/East\nEurope showed solid local-currency sales growth in the quarter, while West Europe was up slightly, and Middle East/Africa declined.\nOrganic local-currency sales in the United States declined, as 3M experienced weak end-market demand in its industrial-related businesses.\nThe consumer-oriented businesses (Health Care and Consumer) continued to deliver positive organic growth. Organic local-currency sales\nin Latin America/Canada declined. In Latin America, Mexico continued its trend of strong organic growth, increasing 7 percent, while\nBrazil declined 6 percent.

Restructuring charges reduced operating income margins by 1.6 percentage points. In addition, higher\npension/postretirement benefit costs reduced margins. These impacts were partially offset by a benefit from the combination of selling price\nincreases and raw material cost decreases.\n \nYear 2015 sales and operating income results: \n \nSales totaled $30.3 billion, a decrease of 4.9 percent from 2014. From a business segment perspective, organic local-currency sales\nincreased 3.7 percent in Health Care, 3.4 percent in Consumer, 2.4 percent in Safety and Graphics, and 0.7 percent in Industrial, while sales\ndeclined 1.9 percent in Electronics and Energy.

Refer to the section entitled “Financial Condition and Liquidity” later in MD&A for a\ndiscussion of items impacting cash flows. In February 2016, 3M’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $10 billion of 3M’s\noutstanding common stock, which replaced the Company’s February 2014 repurchase program. This new program has no pre-established\nend date. In 2015,  2014, and 2013, the Company purchased more than $5 billion of its own stock each year.

This in turn drove year-on-year cost decreases in many feedstock categories, including petroleum based\nmaterials, minerals, metals and wood pulp based products. To date the Company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to\nmeet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements. It is impossible to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such\nshortages would have. 3M has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of existing raw material\ninventories and development and qualification of additional supply sources. 3M manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply\ncontracts, price protection agreements and forward contracts.\n \nPension and postretirement defined benefit/contribution plans:\n \nOn a worldwide basis, 3M’s pension and postretirement plans were 86 percent funded at year-end 2015. The primary U.S. qualified pension\nplan, which is approximately 69 percent of the worldwide pension obligation, was 91 percent funded and the international pension plans\nwere 90 percent funded. The U.S. non-qualified pension plan is not funded due to tax considerations and other factors. Asset returns in 2015\nfor the primary U.S. qualified pension plan was 0.7%, as 3M strategically invests in both growth assets and fixed income matching assets to\nmanage its funded status. For the primary U.S. qualified pension plan, the expected long-term rate of return on an annualized basis for 2016\nis 7.50%, down 0.25% from 2015. The primary U.S. qualified pension plan year-end 2015 discount rate was 4.47%, up 0.37 percentage\npoints from the year-end 2014 discount rate of 4.10%. The increase in U.S. discount rates resulted in a decreased valuation of the projected\nbenefit obligation (PBO), however the plan’s funded status decreased slightly in 2015 as the growth in the PBO increased at a greater rate\nthan the plan assets returned in 2015. Additional detail and discussion of international plan asset returns and discount rates is provided in\nNote 11 (Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans).\n \n3M expects to contribute approximately $100 million to $200 million of cash to its global defined benefit pension and postretirement plans\nin 2016. The Company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2016. 3M expects\nglobal defined benefit pension and postretirement expense in 2016 (before settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other)\nto decrease by approximately $320 million pre-tax when compared to 2015. Refer to “Critical Accounting Estimates” within MD&A and\nNote 11 (Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans) for additional information concerning 3M’s pension and post-retirement plans.\n \nBeginning on January 1, 2016, with respect to defined contribution plans, the Company reduced its match on employee 401(k) contributions\nfor U.S. employees. Previously, based on the date the employee was hired, up to 6% of eligible compensation was matched in cash at rates\nof 60%, 75% or 100%. Beginning in 2016, 5% of eligible compensation will be matched at rates of 45%, 60% or 100%, respectively. The\nreduction in the company’s match is anticipated to reduce 2016 defined contribution pension expense by approximately $35 million.\n \n20\n \nTable of Contents \nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n \nNet Sales:\n \n \n \n2015\n \n2014\n \n \n    \nU.S.\n    \nIntl.\n    \nWorldwide     \nU.S.\n    \nIntl.\n    \nWorldwide  \nNet sales (millions)\n $\n12,049  \n$\n18,225  \n$\n30,274  \n$\n11,714  \n$\n20,107  \n$\n31,821  \n% of worldwide sales\n  \n39.8 %   \n60.2 %   \n  \n \n36.8 %   \n63.2 %   \n  \nComponents of net sales change:\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nVolume — organic\n  \n1.7 %   \n(0.5)%   \n0.2 %   \n4.4 %   \n3.8 %   \n3.9 %\nPrice\n  \n0.4  \n \n1.4  \n \n1.1  \n \n0.5  \n \n1.2  \n \n1.0  \nOrganic local-currency sales\n  \n2.1  \n \n0.9  \n \n1.3  \n \n4.9  \n \n5.0  \n \n4.9  \nAcquisitions\n  \n1.2  \n \n0.5  \n \n0.8  \n \n0.2  \n \n —  \n \n0.1  \nDivestitures\n  \n(0.4) \n \n(0.1) \n \n(0.2) \n \n(0.1) \n \n—  \n \n—  \nTranslation\n  \n—  \n \n(10.7) \n \n(6.8) \n \n—  \n \n(3.0) \n \n(1.9) \nTotal sales change\n  \n2.9 %   \n(9.4)%   \n(4.9)%   \n5.0 %   \n2.0 %   \n3.1 %\n \nIn 2015, organic local-currency sales grew 1.3 percent, with increases of 2.1 percent in the United States, 1.5 percent in Latin\nAmerica/Canada, 0.9 percent in Asia Pacific, and 0.8 percent in EMEA.

This is enabled by the ongoing multi-year phased implementation of an enterprise\nresource planning (ERP) system on a worldwide basis.\n \nIn the fourth quarter of 2015, as discussed within the Overview section above, 3M incurred restructuring charges impacting operating\nexpenses as follows:\n \n \n \n \n(Millions)\n    \n2015\n \nCost of sales\n \n \n40  \nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n \n \n62  \nResearch, development and related expenses\n \n \n12  \nTotal\n \n$\n114  \n \nCost of Sales:\n \nCost of sales includes manufacturing, engineering and freight costs.\n \nCost of sales, measured as a percent of net sales, was 50.9 percent in 2015, a decrease of 0.8 percentage points from 2014. Cost of sales as a\npercent of sales decreased due to the combination of selling price increases and raw material cost decreases, as selling prices increased net\nsales by 1.1 percent and raw material cost deflation was favorable by approximately 3.5 percent year-on-year. In addition, higher pension\nand postretirement costs (of which a portion impacts cost of sales) and fourth quarter 2015 restructuring charges, increased cost of sales as a\npercent of sales.\n \nCost of sales, measured as a percent of net sales, was 51.7 percent in 2014, a decrease of 0.4 percentage points from 2013. Cost of sales as a\npercent of sales decreased due to the combination of selling price increases and raw material cost decreases, as selling prices increased net\nsales by 1.0 percent and raw material cost deflation was favorable by approximately 1.5 percent year-on-year. In addition, lower pension and\npostretirement costs (of which a portion impacts cost of sales), along with organic volume leverage, decreased cost of sales as a percent of\nsales.\n \nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses:\n \nSelling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) decreased $287 million, or 4.4 percent, in 2015 when compared to 2014. The\ntranslation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars reduced SG&A expense, as evidenced by our foreign currency translation impact which\nreduced worldwide sales by 6.8 percent. This foreign currency translation benefit was partially offset by higher pension and postretirement\nexpense and fourth quarter 2015 restructuring charges. SG&A, measured as a percent of sales, increased 0.1 percentage points to 20.4\npercent in 2015, compared to 20.3 percent of sales in 2014.\n \nSelling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) increased $85 million, or 1.3 percent, in 2014 when compared to 2013. Year 2014\nincluded strategic investments in business transformation, while lower pension and postretirement expense benefitted SG&A. SG&A,\nmeasured as a percent of sales, decreased 0.4 percentage points to 20.3 percent in 2014, compared to 2\n\n--------------------------------\nAnd here is your task:\n\nExtract the exact figure (in millions) for \'Total Revenue\' or \'Net Sales\' for the year 2014.

R&D increased 3.2\npercent in 2014 compared to 2013. 3M continued to support its key growth initiatives, including more R&D aimed at disruptive innovation,\nwhich refers to innovation which has the potential to create new markets and disrupt existing markets. In 2015, like SG&A, R&D spending\nin U.S. dollars was reduced due to the translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars. These 2015 translation benefits were partially offset\nby higher pension and postretirement expense in 2015 when compared to 2014. In 2014, increases in R&D, when compared to 2013, were\npartially offset by lower pension and postretirement expense. R&D, measured as a percent of sales, was 5.8 percent in 2015, compared to\n5.6 percent in both 2014 and 2013.\n \n22\n \nTable of Contents \nOperating Income:\n \n3M uses operating income as one of its primary business segment performance measurement tools. Refer to the table below for a\nreconciliation of operating income margins for 2015 versus 2014, and 2014 versus 2013.\n \nOperating income margin:\n \n    \nYear ended \n \n \n \nDecember 31,\n \n(Percent of net sales)\n    \n2015\n \n2014\n \nSame period last year\n \n22.4 %\n21.6 %\nIncrease/(decrease) in operating income margin, due to:\n \n  \n  \nSelling price and raw material impacts\n \n1.6  \n1.0  \nOrganic volume growth\n \n —  \n0.3  \nPension and postretirement benefit costs\n \n(0.5) \n0.5  \nAcquisitions and divestitures\n \n(0.2) \n(0.1) \nStrategic investments\n \n(0.3) \n(0.6) \nForeign exchange impacts\n \n —  \n(0.3) \nRestructuring charges\n \n(0.4) \n —  \nProductivity and other\n \n0.3  \n —  \nCurrent period\n \n22.9 %\n22.4 %\n \nOperating income margins were 22.9 percent in 2015 compared to 22.4 percent in 2014, an increase of 0.5 percentage points. These results\nincluded a significant benefit from the combination of higher selling prices and lower raw material costs, and a benefit from productivity\nand other items. These benefits were partially offset by higher pension and postretirement benefit costs, 2015 restructuring charges, higher\nstrategic investments, and acquisition and divestiture impacts. Strategic investments include incremental programs around disruptive R&D\nand business transformation. Acquisition and divestiture impacts primarily relate to the Capital Safety and Polypore Separations Media\nacquisitions, and the divestitures of substantially all of the library systems business, along with the license plate converting business in\nFrance. \n \nOperating income margins were 22.4 percent in 2014 compared to 21.6 percent in 2013, an increase of 0.8 percentage points. These results\nincluded a significant benefit from the combination of higher selling prices and lower raw material costs. In addition, lower year-on-year\npension and postretirement benefit costs and profit leverage on organic volume growth provided benefits. Items that reduced operating\nincome margins included strategic investments, which included investments in disruptive R&D, business transformation, the supply chain\ncenter of expertise in Europe, and portfolio management actions. The Company invested $90 million in 2014 in portfolio management\nactions to position 3M for greater success. Foreign currency effects and acquisition impacts (Treo) reduced operating income margins.\n \nInterest Expense and Income:\n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n(Millions)\n    \n2015\n    \n2014\n    \n2013\n \nInterest expense\n $\n149  $\n142  $\n145  \nInterest income\n  \n(26)  \n(33)  \n(41) \nTotal\n $\n123  $\n109  $\n104  \n \nInterest Expense:  Interest expense increased slightly in 2015 compared to 2014, despite significantly higher debt levels, helped by lower\naverage interest rates. Interest expense decreased in 2014 compared to 2013, again despite higher debt levels, primarily due to lower U.S.\nborrowing costs as debt maturities were replaced with lower cost financing from commercial paper and lower interest rates on new debt\nissuances.\n \nCapitalized interest related to property, plant and equipment construction in progress is recorded as a reduction to interest expense. The\namounts shown in the table above for interest expense are net of capitalized interest amounts of $13 million, $15 million, and $21 million, in\n2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\n \n23\n \nTable of Contents \nInterest Income: Interest income in 2015 was lower when compared to 2014 due to lower average cash/marketable securities balances.\nInterest income in 2014 was lower when compared to 2013 due to lower cash balances.\n \nProvision for Income Taxes:\n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(Percent of pre-tax income)\n    \n2015\n    \n2014\n    \n2013\n \nEffective tax rate\n \n29.1 %  \n28.9 %  \n28.1 %\n \nThe effective tax rate for 2015 was 29.1 percent, compared to 28.9 percent in 2014, an increase of 0.2 percentage points.  The effective tax\nrate for 2014 was 28.9 percent, compared to 28.1 percent in 2013, an increase of 0.8 percentage points.  The changes in the rates between\nyears are impacted by many factors, as described further in Note 8.\n \nThe Company currently expects that its effective tax rate for 2016 will be approximately 29.5 to 30.5 percent. The rate can vary from\nquarter to quarter due to discrete items, such as the settlement of income tax audits and changes in tax laws, as well as recurring factors,\nsuch as the geographic mix of income before taxes.\n \nRefer to Note 8 for further discussion of income taxes.\n \nNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest:\n \n(Millions)\n    \n2015\n    \n2014\n    \n2013\n \nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interest\n $\n8  $\n42  $\n62  \n \nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interest represents the elimination of the income or loss attributable to non-3M ownership interests\nin 3M consolidated entities. The changes in noncontrolling interest amounts have largely related to Sumitomo 3M Limited (Japan), which\nwas 3M’s most significant consolidated entity with non-3M ownership interests. As discussed in Note 6, on September 1, 2014, 3M\npurchased the remaining 25 percent ownership in Sumitomo 3M Limited, bringing 3M’s ownership to 100 percent. Thus, effective\nSeptember 1, 2014, net income attributable to noncontrolling interest was significantly reduced. The primary remaining noncontrolling\ninterest relates to 3M India Limited, of which 3M’s effective ownership is 75 percent.\n \nCurrency Effects:\n \n3M estimates that year-on-year currency effects, including hedging impacts, decreased pre-tax income by approximately $390 million and\n$100 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. These estimates include the effect of translating profits from local currencies into U.S. dollars;\nthe impact of currency fluctuations on the transfer of goods between 3M operations in the United States and abroad; and transaction gains\nand losses, including derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks and the negative impact of swapping\nVenezuelan bolivars into U.S. dollars. 3M estimates that year-on-year derivative and other transaction gains and losses increased pre-tax\nincome by approximately $180 million and $10 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Refer to Note 12 in the Consolidated Financial\nStatements for additional information concerning 3M’s hedging activities. \n \nPERFORMANCE BY BUSINESS SEGMENT\n \nDisclosures relating to 3M’s business segments are provided in Item 1, Business Segments. Financial information and other disclosures are\nprovided in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  As described in Note 16, effective in the third quarter of 2015, within the\nHealth Care business segment, the Company formed the Oral Care Solutions Division, which combined the former 3M ESPE and 3M\nUnitek divisions. 3M manages its operations in five business segments. The reportable segments are Industrial; Safety and Graphics;\nElectronics and Energy; Health Care; and Consumer.\n \n24\n \nTable of Contents \nCorporate and Unallocated:\n \nIn addition to these five business segments, 3M assigns certain costs to “Corporate and Unallocated,” which is presented separately in the\npreceding business segments table and in Note 16. Corporate and Unallocated includes a variety of miscellaneous items, such as corporate\ninvestment gains and losses, certain derivative gains and losses, certain insurance-related gains and losses, certain litigation and\nenvironmental expenses, corporate restructuring charges and certain under- or over-absorbed costs (e.g. pension, stock-based compensation)\nthat the Company determines not to allocate directly to its business segments. Because this category includes a variety of miscellaneous\nitems, it is subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis.\n \nCorporate and Unallocated operating expenses increased by $104 million in 2015 when compared to 2014. This increase was driven by\nhigher pension and postretirement benefit expenses, which increased in total by $165 million. Of this increase, $153 million was allocated to\nCorporate and Unallocated. Increases were also driven by fourth quarter 2015 restructuring charges of $37 million, as indicated in the below\ntable. Items which partially offset these increases within Corporate and Unallocated included higher administrative and R&D cost\nabsorption by the five business segments, resulting in less under-absorbed expense being allocated to Corporate.\n \nCorporate and Unallocated operating expenses decreased by $70 million in 2014 when compared to 2013. This decrease was driven by lower\npension and postretirement benefit expenses, which declined year-on-year by $162 million. Of this reduction, $116 million was allocated to\nCorporate and Unallocated. This was partially offset by higher Corporate and Unallocated expenses related to year-on-year increases in\nannual incentive plan expenses and legal accruals.\n \nRestructuring Pre-Tax Charge by Business Segment:\n \n\n--------------------------------\nAnd here is your task:\n\nExtract the exact figure (in millions) for \'Total Revenue\' or \'Net Sales\' for the year 2014.

Capital spending is discussed in more detail later in MD&A in the section entitled “Cash Flows from Investing Activities.”\n \n \nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\n \nInformation regarding significant accounting policies is included in Note 1. As stated in Note 1, the preparation of financial statements\nrequires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and\nrelated disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions\nthat are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying\nvalues of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n \nThe Company believes its most critical accounting estimates relate to legal proceedings, the Company’s pension and postretirement\nobligations, asset impairments and income taxes. Senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of its critical\naccounting estimates with the Audit Committee of 3M’s Board of Directors.\n \nLegal Proceedings:\n \nThe categories of claims for which the Company has a probable and estimable liability, the amount of its liability accruals, and the estimates\nof its related insurance receivables are critical accounting estimates related to legal proceedings.

The primary U.S. defined-benefit pension plan was closed to new participants effective January 1, 2009. The Company accounts for\nits defined benefit pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans in accordance with Accounting Standard\nCodification (ASC) 715, Compensation — Retirement Benefits, in measuring plan assets and benefit obligations and in determining the\namount of net periodic benefit cost. ASC 715 requires employers to recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit\npension or postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and recognize changes in the funded status in the\nyear in which the changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a component of stockholders’ equity. While\nthe company believes the valuation methods used to determine the fair value of plan assets are appropriate and consistent with other market\nparticipants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a\ndifferent estimate of fair value at the reporting date. See Note 11 for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining\npension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses.\n \nPension benefits associated with these plans are generally based primarily on each participant’s years of service, compensation, and age at\nretirement or termination. The benefit obligation represents the present value of the benefits that employees are entitled to in the future for\nservices already rendered as of the measurement date. The Company measures the present value of these future benefits by projecting\nbenefit payment cash flows for each future period and discounting these cash flows back to the December 31 measurement date, using the\nyields of a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle\nprojected future benefits. Historically, the single aggregated discount rate used for each plan’s benefit obligation was also used for the\ncalculation of all net periodic benefit costs, including the measurement of the service and interest costs. Beginning in 2016, 3M changed the\nmethod used to estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs. The new\nmethod measures service cost and interest cost separately using the spot yield curve approach applied to each corresponding obligation.\nService costs are determined based on duration-specific spot rates applied to the service cost cash flows. The interest cost calculation is\ndetermined by applying duration-specific spot rates to the year-by-year projected benefit payments. The spot yield curve approach does not\naffect the measurement of the total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest costs offset in the actuarial gains and losses\nrecorded in other comprehensive income. The Company changed to the new method to provide a more precise measure of service and\ninterest costs by improving the correlation between the projected benefit cash flows and the discrete spot yield curve rates. The Company\naccounted for this change as a change in estimate prospectively beginning in the first quarter of 2016. As a result of the change to the spot\nyield curve approach, 2016 defined benefit pension and postretirement net periodic benefit cost is expected to decrease by $180 million.\nIncluding this $180 million, 3M expects global defined benefit pension and postretirement expense in 2016 (before settlements,\ncurtailments, special termination benefits and other) to decrease by approximately $320 million pre-tax when compared to 2015.\n \nUsing this methodology, the Company determined discount rates for its plans as follow:\n \n \nU.S. Qualified\nPension\n    \nInternational\nPension\n(weighted\naverage)\n    \nU.S.\nPostretirement\nMedical\n \nDecember 31, 2014 Liability and 2015 Net Periodic Benefit Cost:\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSingle discount rate\n \n4.10 %\n3.11 %\n4.07 %\nDecember 31, 2015 Liability:\n \n  \n  \n  \nBenefit obligation\n \n4.47 %\n3.12 %\n4.32 %\n2016 Net Periodic Benefit Cost Components:\n \n  \n  \n  \nService cost\n \n4.72 %\n2.84 %\n4.60 %\nInterest cost\n \n3.77 %\n2.72 %\n3.44 %\n \nAnother significant element in determining the Company’s pension expense in accordance with ASC 715 is the expected return on plan\nassets, which is based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes. For the primary U.S. qualified pension plan, the\nexpected long-term rate of return on an annualized basis for 2016 is 7.50%, 0.25% lower than 2015. Refer to Note 11 for information on\nhow the 2015 rate was determined. Return on assets assumptions for\n35\n \nTable of Contents \ninternational pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are calculated on a plan-by-plan basis using plan asset allocations and expected\nlong-term rate of return assumptions. The weighted average expected return for the international pension plan is 5.77% for 2016, compared\nto 5.90% for 2015.\n \nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recognized total consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement\nexpense (after settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other) of $556 million, up from $391 million in 2014. Defined\nbenefit pension and postretirement expense (before settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other) is anticipated to\ndecrease to approximately $236 million in 2016, a decrease of $320 million compared to 2015.\n \nThe table below summarizes the impact on 2016 pension expense for the U.S. and international pension plans of a 0.25 percentage point\nincrease/decrease in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumptions used to measure plan liabilities and\n2016 net periodic benefit cost.

This includes the recoverability of long-lived assets employed in the business, including assets of acquired businesses.\nThese estimates and assumptions are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant. For instance,\nexpected asset lives may be shortened or an impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the\nrelated asset group.\n \n3M goodwill totaled approximately $9.2 billion as of December 31, 2015. 3M’s annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in the\nfourth quarter of each year. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level, with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit.\nReporting units are one level below the business segment level, but can be combined when reporting units within the same segment have\nsimilar economic characteristics. At 3M, reporting units generally correspond to a division. 3M did not combine any of its reporting units\nfor impairment testing.\n \nAn impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the estimated fair\nvalue of the reporting unit. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a\nprice/earnings ratio for comparable industry groups, or by using a discounted cash flow analysis. 3M typically uses the price/earnings ratio\napproach for stable and growing businesses that have a long history and track record of generating positive operating income and cash\nflows. 3M uses the discounted cash flow approach for start-up, loss position and declining businesses, in addition to businesses where the\nprice/earnings ratio valuation method indicates additional review is warranted. 3M also uses discounted cash flow as an additional tool for\nbusinesses that may be growing at a slower rate than planned due to economic or other conditions.\n \nAs described in Note 16, effective in the third quarter of 2015, within the Health Care business segment, the Company formed the Oral Care\nSolutions Division, which combined the former 3M ESPE and 3M Unitek divisions. For any product moves that resulted in reporting unit\nchanges, the Company applied the relative fair value method to determine the impact on goodwill of the associated reporting units. During\nthe third quarter of 2015, the Company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting units impacted by this\nnew structure and determined that no impairment existed. The discussion that follows relates to the separate fourth quarter 2015 annual\nimpairment test and is in the context of the reporting unit structure that existed at that time.\n \nAs of October 1, 2015, 3M had 26 primary reporting units, with ten reporting units accounting for approximately 87 percent of the goodwill.\nThese ten reporting units were comprised of the following divisions: 3M purification (which\n36\n \nTable of Contents \nincludes the Polypore Separations Media acquisition), Advanced Materials, Communication Markets, Display Materials and Systems,\nHealth Information Systems, Industrial Adhesives and Tape\n\n--------------------------------\nAnd here is your task:\n\nExtract the exact figure (in millions) for \'Total Revenue\' or \'Net Sales\' for the year 2014.

The estimated fair values for these reporting units were in excess of carrying\nvalue by approximately 50 percent or more, except for one reporting unit with approximately $300 million of goodwill, where the fair value\nexceeded the carrying value by approximately 30 percent. 3M’s market value at both September 30, 2015, and December 31, 2015, was\nsignificantly in excess of its equity of approximately $12 billion at both December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015.\n \nIn 2015, 3M primarily used an industry price-earnings ratio approach, but also used a discounted cash flows approach for certain reporting\nunits, to determine fair values. Where applicable, 3M used a weighted-average discounted cash flow analysis for certain divisions, using\nprojected cash flows that were weighted based on different sales growth and terminal value assumptions, among other factors. The\nweighting was based on management’s estimates of the likelihood of each scenario occurring.\n \n3M is an integrated materials enterprise, thus many of 3M’s businesses could not easily be sold on a stand-alone basis. 3M’s focus on\nresearch and development has resulted in a portion of 3M’s value being comprised of internally developed businesses that have no goodwill\nassociated with them. Based on the annual test in the fourth quarter of 2015, no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting\nunits.\n \nFactors which could result in future impairment charges include, among others, changes in worldwide economic conditions, changes in\ncompetitive conditions and customer preferences, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. These risk factors are discussed in\nItem 1A, “Risk Factors,” of this document. In addition, changes in the weighted average cost of capital could also impact impairment testing\nresults. As indicated above, during the third quarter of 2015, the Company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment\nfor reporting units impacted by changes between reporting units and determined that no impairment existed. Long-lived assets with a\ndefinite life are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset\ngroup) may not be recoverable. If future non-cash asset impairment charges are taken, 3M would expect that only a portion of the long-lived\nassets or goodwill would be impaired. 3M will continue to monitor its reporting units and asset groups in 2016 for any triggering events or\nother indicators of impairment.\n \nIncome Taxes:\n \nThe extent of 3M’s operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude\nof jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions\nand resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. The Company recognizes potential liabilities and records\ntax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether, and the extent\nto which, additional taxes will be due. The Company follows guidance provided by ASC 740, Income Taxes, regarding uncertainty in\nincome taxes, to record these liabilities (refer to Note 8 for additional information). The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing\nfacts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that\nis materially different from the Company’s current estimate of the tax liabilities. If the Company’s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be\nless than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less\nthan the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the Company\ndetermines the liabilities are no longer necessary.\n \nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\n \nInformation regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n \n37\n \nTable of Contents \nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY\n \n3M continues its transition to a better-optimized capital structure and is adding leverage at a measured pace. The strength and stability of\n3M\'s business model and strong free cash flow capability, together with proven capital markets access, enable the Company to implement\nthis strategy. Investing in 3M’s businesses to drive organic growth remains the first priority, thus 3M will continue to deploy capital towards\nresearch and development, capital expenditures, and commercialization capability. Investment in organic growth will be supplemented by\ncomplementary acquisitions. 3M will also continue to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Sources for cash\navailability in the United States, such as ongoing cash flow from operations and access to capital markets, have historically been sufficient\nto fund dividend payments to shareholders and share repurchases, as well as funding U.S. acquisitions and other items as needed. For those\ninternational earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely, the Company currently has no plans or intentions to repatriate these funds for\nU.S. operations. However, if these international funds are needed for operations in the U.S., 3M would be required to accrue and pay U.S.\ntaxes to repatriate them. See Note 8 for further information on earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely.\n \n3M’s primary short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand and U.S. commercial paper issuances. The Company believes it will\nhave continuous access to the commercial paper market. 3M’s commercial paper program permits the Company to have a maximum of $3\nbillion outstanding with a maximum maturity of 397 days from date of issuance.\n \nNet Debt:\n \nThe Company defines net debt as total debt less the total of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. 3M considers net debt and its\ncomponents to be an important indicator of liquidity and a guiding measure of capital structure strategy. Net debt is not defined under U.S.\ngenerally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. The\nfollowing table provides net debt as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.\n \nAt December 31\n        \n \n        \n \n \n(Millions)\n \n2015\n \n2014\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \nTotal Debt\n $\n10,797  $\n6,811  \nLess: Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities\n \n \n1,925  \n \n3,351  \nNet Debt\n $\n8,872  $\n3,460  \n \nIn 2015, net debt rose by $5.4 billion to a net debt balance of $8.9 billion (as of December 31, 2015), as 3M progressed on its capital\nstructure strategy. Debt levels were higher in both the U.S. and internationally, while international cash and marketable securities balances\nwere reduced. Specific actions related to cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, in addition to debt, are discussed further below.\n \nCash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities:\n \nAt December 31, 2015, 3M had $1.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which approximately $1.7 billion was\nheld by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries and $200 million was held by the United States. Of the $1.7 billion held internationally, U.S.\ndollar-based cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $355 million, or 21 percent, which was invested in money market\nfunds, asset-backed securities, agency securities, corporate medium-term note securities and other high quality fixed income securities. At\nDecember 31, 2014, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries and in the United States\ntotaled approximately $3.3 billion and less than $100 million, respectively.\n \nThe Company’s total balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was $1.4 billion lower at December 31, 2015 when\ncompared to December 31, 2014. 3M was able to manage the business with lower cash levels due to significant ongoing cash flow\ngeneration and proven access to capital markets funding throughout business cycles.\n \n38\n \nTable of Contents \nTotal Debt:\n \nThe Company’s total debt was $4.0 billion higher at December 31, 2015 when compared to December 31, 2014. The strength of 3M’s\ncapital structure and significant ongoing cash flows provide 3M proven access to capital markets. Additionally, the Company’s maturity\nprofile is staggered to help ensure refinancing needs in any given year are reasonable in proportion to the total portfolio. The Company has\nan AA- credit rating, with a stable outlook, from Standard & Poor’s and an Aa3 credit rating, with a negative outlook, from Moody’s\nInvestors Service. The Company’s ongoing transition to a better-optimized capital structure, financed with additional low-cost debt, could\nimpact 3M’s credit rating in the future.\n \nEffective May 16, 2014, the Company updated its “well-known seasoned issuer” shelf registration statement, which registers an\nindeterminate amount of debt or equity securities for future sales. This replaced 3M’s previous shelf registration dated August 5, 2011. In\nJune 2014, in connection with the May 16, 2014 shelf registration, 3M re-commenced its medium-term notes program (Series F) under\nwhich 3M may issue, from time to time, up to $9 billion aggregate principal amount of notes. Included in this $9 billion are $8.17 billion\n(utilizing the foreign exchange rate applicable at the time of issuance for the Euro denominated debt) of notes previously issued in 2011,\n2012, 2014, and 2015 as part of Series F.

This credit agreement includes a provision\nunder which 3M may request an increase of up to $2.25 billion, bringing the total facility up to $4.5 billion (at the lenders’ discretion). This\nfacility was undrawn at December 31, 2015. Under the $2.25 billion credit agreement, the Company is required to maintain its EBITDA to\nInterest Ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter at not less than 3.0 to 1. This is calculated (as defined in the agreement) as the ratio of\nconsolidated total EBITDA for the four consecutive quarters then ended to total interest expense on all funded debt for the same period. At\nDecember 31, 2015, this ratio was approximately 56 to 1. Debt covenants do not restrict the payment of dividends. Apart from the\ncommitted facilities, an additional $241 million in stand-alone letters of credit and $18 million in bank guarantees were also issued and\noutstanding at December 31, 2015. These lines of credit are utilized in connection with normal business activities.\n \nBalance Sheet:\n \n3M’s strong balance sheet and liquidity provide the Company with significant flexibility to take advantage of numerous opportunities going\nforward. The Company will continue to invest in its operations to drive growth, including continual review of acquisition opportunities.\n \nVarious assets and liabilities, including cash and short-term debt, can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on short-term\nliquidity needs. Working capital (defined as current assets minus current liabilities) totaled $3.868 billion at December 31, 2015, compared\nwith $6.339 billion at December 31, 2014, a decrease of $2.471 billion. Current asset balance changes decreased working capital by $1.317\nbillion, driven by decreases in marketable securities. Current liability balance changes decreased working capital by $1.154 billion, driven\nby increases in short-term debt.\n \nThe Company uses various working capital measures that place emphasis and focus on certain working capital assets and liabilities. These\nmeasures are not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled\nmeasures used by other companies. One of the primary working capital measures 3M uses is a combined index, which includes accounts\nreceivable, inventories and accounts payable. This combined index (defined as quarterly net sales — fourth quarter at year-end —\nmultiplied by four, divided by ending net accounts receivable plus inventories less accounts payable) was 4.9 at December 31, 2015\ncompared to 5.0 at December 31, 2014. Receivables decreased $84 million, or 2.0 percent, compared with December 31, 2014,  as currency\ntranslation impacts decreased accounts receivable by $239 million, partially offset by 2015 acquisitions that added $103 million. Inventories\ndecreased $188 million, or 5.1 percent, compared with December 31, 2014. The inventory decrease was attributable to currency translation,\nwhich decreased inventories by $272 million, partially offset by 2015 acquisitions that added $102 million.  \n39\n \nTable of Contents \nAccounts payable decreased by $113 million compared with December 31, 2014, as currency translation impacts reduced accounts payable\nby $76 million.\n \nReturn on Invested Capital (non-GAAP measure):\n \nThe Company uses non-GAAP measures to focus on shareholder value creation. 3M uses return on invested capital (ROIC), defined as\nannualized after-tax operating income (including interest income) divided by average operating capital. Operating capital is defined as net\nassets (total assets less total liabilities) excluding debt. This measure is not recognized under U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to\nsimilarly titled measures used by other companies. ROIC was 22.5 percent for 2015, and 22.0 percent for 2014.\n \nCash Flows:\n \nCash flows from operating, investing and financing activities are provided in the tables that follow. Individual amounts in the Consolidated\nStatement of Cash Flows exclude the effects of acquisitions, divestitures and exchange rate impacts on cash and cash equivalents, which are\npresented separately in the cash flows.

Operating cash flows decreased due to $363\nmillion in higher cash income taxes when comparing 2015 to 2014, plus lower net income, which was partially offset by lower year-on-year\nworking capital requirements. The combination of accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable increased working capital by $46\nmillion in 2015, compared to increases of $306 million in 2014, with the year-on-year improvement related to lower organic volume growth.\nAdditional discussion on working capital changes is provided earlier in the “Financial Condition and Liquidity” section.\n \nIn 2014, cash flows provided by operating activities increased $809 million compared to 2013. Operating cash flows benefited year-on-year\nfrom increases in net income including noncontrolling interest, lower pension and postretirement plans contributions, and lower year-on-\nyear working capital requirements. The combination of accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable increased working capital by\n$306 million in 2014, compared to increases of $407 million in 2013, with the year-on-year improvement partially due to higher receivable\nand inventory turns. Additional discussion on working capital changes is provided earlier in the “Financial Condition and Liquidity” section.\n40\n \nTable of Contents \n \nFree Cash Flow (non-GAAP measure):\n \nIn addition, to net cash provided by operating activities, 3M believes free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are useful measures of\nperformance and uses these measures as an indication of the strength of the Company and its ability to generate cash. Free cash flow and\nfree cash flow conversion are not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Therefore, they should not be\nconsidered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled\nmeasures used by other companies. 3M defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant\nand equipment (which is classified as an investing activity). It should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for\ndiscretionary expenditures. 3M defines free cash flow conversion as free cash flow divided by net income attributable to 3M.

Total debt\nwas 48 percent of total capital (total capital is defined as debt plus equity) at year-end 2015,  34 percent of total capital at year-end 2014,\nand 25 percent of total capital at year-end 2013.  \n \nIn both 2015 and 2014, the change in short-term debt primarily related to bank borrowings by international subsidiaries, primarily Japan\nand Korea in 2015. In 2015, repayment of debt primarily related to debt assumed (and paid off) as part of the Capital Safety acquisition\n(refer to Note 2). In 2014, repayment of debt primarily includes repayment of a Eurobond in July 2014 totaling 1.025 billion Euros\n(approximately $1.4 billion carrying value), repayment of the three-year 66 million British Pound committed credit facility agreement\nentered into in December 2012, and repayment of other international debt.

In addition, proceeds from debt for 2014 also include bank borrowings by international subsidiaries. Proceeds\nfrom debt in 2013 related to the November 2013 issuance of an eight-year Eurobond for an amount of 600 million Euros. Refer to Note 10\nfor additional discussion of debt.\n \nRepurchases of common stock are made to support the Company’s stock-based employee compensation plans and for other corporate\npurposes. In February 2016, 3M’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $10 billion of 3M’s outstanding common stock,\nwhich replaced the Company’s February 2014 repurchase program. This authorization has no pre-established end date. In 2015, 2014, and\n2013, the Company purchased more than $5 billion of its own stock each year. The Company expects full-year 2016 gross share\nrepurchases will be in the range of $4 billion to $6 billion. For more information, refer to the table titled “Issuer Purchases of Equity\nSecurities” in Part II, Item 5. The Company does not utilize derivative instruments linked to the Company’s stock.\n \nCash dividends paid to shareholders totaled $2.561 billion ($4.10 per share) in 2015, $2.216 billion ($3.42 per share) in 2014, and $1.730\nbillion ($2.54 per share) in 2013. 3M has paid dividends since 1916. In February 2016, 3M’s Board of Directors declared a first-quarter\n2016 dividend of $1.11 per share, an increase of 8  percent. This is equivalent to an annual dividend of $4.44 per share and marked the 58th\nconsecutive year of dividend increases.\n \nOn September 1, 2014, 3M purchased (via Sumitomo 3M Limited) Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd.’s 25 percent interest in 3M’s\nconsolidated Sumitomo 3M Limited subsidiary for 90 billion Japanese Yen. Upon completion of this transaction, 3M owned 100 percent of\nSumitomo 3M Limited. This was reflected as a “Purchase of noncontrolling interest” in the financing section of the consolidated statement\nof cash flows. In addition, in April 2014, 3M purchased the remaining noncontrolling interest in a consolidated 3M subsidiary for an\nimmaterial amount, which was also classified as a “Purchase of noncontrolling interest” in the financing section of the consolidated\nstatement of cash flows.\n \nIn March 2013, 3M sold shares in 3M India Limited, a subsidiary of the Company, in return for $8 million. The noncontrolling interest\nshares of this subsidiary trade on a public exchange in India. This sale of shares complied with an amendment to Indian securities\nregulations that required 3M India Limited, as a listed company, to achieve a minimum public shareholding of at least 25 percent. As a\nresult of this transaction, 3M’s ownership in 3M India Limited was reduced from 76 percent to 75 percent. The $8 million received in the\nfirst quarter of 2013 was classified as other financing activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows.\n \nIn addition to the March 2013 sale of noncontrolling interest described above, other cash flows from financing activities may include\nvarious other items, such as changes in cash overdraft balances, and principal payments for capital leases.\n \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations:\n \nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company has not utilized special purpose entities to facilitate off-balance sheet financing arrangements. Refer\nto the section entitled “Warranties/Guarantees” in Note 14 for discussion of accrued product warranty liabilities and guarantees.\n \nIn addition to guarantees, 3M, in the normal course of business, periodically enters into agreements that require the Company to indemnify\neither major customers or suppliers for specific risks, such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of the use of 3M products or\nthe negligence of 3M personnel, or claims alleging that 3M products infringe third-party patents or other intellectual property.

Interest projections on both floating and fixed rate long-term debt, including the effects of interest\nrate swaps, are based on effective interest rates as of December 31, 2015.\n \nUnconditional purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the\nCompany. Included in the unconditional purchase obligations category above are certain obligations related to take or pay contracts, capital\ncommitments, service agreements and utilities. These estimates include both unconditional purchase obligations with terms in excess of one\nyear and normal ongoing purchase obligations with terms of less than one year. Many of these commitments relate to take or pay contracts,\nin which 3M guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or services that are sold to customers. The Company expects to receive\nconsideration (products or services) for these unconditional purchase obligations. Contractual capital commitments are included in the\npreceding table, but these commitments represent a small part of the Company’s expected capital spending in 2016 and beyond. The\npurchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items for which the\nCompany is contractually obligated. The majority of 3M’s products and services are purchased as needed, with no unconditional\ncommitment. For this reason, these amounts will not provide a reliable indicator of the Company’s expected future cash outflows on a stand-\nalone basis.\n \nOther obligations, included in the preceding table within the caption entitled “Unconditional purchase obligations and other,” include the\ncurrent portion of the liability for uncertain tax positions under ASC 740, which is expected to be paid out in cash in the next 12 months.\nThe Company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the long-term payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or\ndecrease over time; therefore, the long-term portion of the net tax liability of $208 million is excluded from the preceding table. Refer to\nNote 8 for further details.\n \nAs discussed in Note 11, the Company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2016\nand Company contributions to its U.S. and international pension plans are expected to be largely discretionary in future years; therefore,\namounts related to these plans are not included in the preceding table.\n \nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n \nThe Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts, options and swaps to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on\ncash flows denominated in foreign currencies and certain intercompany financing transactions. The Company manages interest rate risks\nusing a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. To help manage borrowing costs, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps. Under these\narrangements, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated\nby reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. The Company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply\ncontracts, price protection agreements and forward contracts.\n44\n \nTable of Contents \n \nRefer to Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk”, for further discussion of foreign exchange rates risk,\ninterest rates risk, commodity prices risk and value at risk analysis.\n \nItem 7A. Quantitative  and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\n \nIn the context of Item 7A, 3M is exposed to market risk due to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange\nrates, interest rates and commodity prices. Changes in those factors could cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flows. Senior management\nprovides oversight for risk management and derivative activities, determines certain of the Company’s financial risk policies and objectives,\nand provides guidelines for derivative instrument utilization. Senior management also establishes certain associated procedures relative to\ncontrol and valuation, risk analysis, counterparty credit approval, and ongoing monitoring and reporting.\n \nThe Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties in interest rate swaps, currency swaps, commodity\nprice swaps, and forward and option contracts. However, the Company’s risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments. The Company\nactively monitors its exposure to credit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit limits, and by selecting major international banks\nand financial institutions as counterparties. The Company does not anticipate nonperformance by any of these counterparties.\n \nForeign Exchange Rates Risk:\n \nForeign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the Company’s net investment in foreign subsidiaries and may\ncause fluctuations in cash flows related to foreign denominated transactions. 3M is also exposed to the translation of foreign currency\nearnings to the U.S. dollar. The Company enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange\nrate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. These transactions are designated as cash flow hedges. 3M may\ndedesignate these cash flow hedge relationships in advance of the occurrence of the forecasted transaction. Beginning in the second quarter\nof 2014, 3M began extending the maximum length of time over which it hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows of the\nforecasted transactions from a previous term of 12 months to a longer term of 24 months, with certain currencies being extended further to\n36 months starting in the first quarter of 2015. In addition, 3M enters into foreign currency forward contracts that are not designated in\nhedging relationships to offset, in part, the impacts of certain intercompany activities (primarily associated with intercompany licensing\narrangements and intercompany financing transactions). As circumstances warrant, the Company also uses foreign currency forward\ncontracts and foreign currency denominated debt as hedging instruments to hedge portions of the Company’s net investments in foreign\noperations. The dollar equivalent gross notional amount of the Company’s foreign exchange forward and option contracts designated as cash\nflow hedges and those not designated as hedging instruments were $2.8 billion and $5.4 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2015. As of\nDecember 31, 2015, the Company had 974 million Euros and 248 billion South Korean Won in notional amount of foreign currency\nforward contracts designated as net investment hedges along with 3.6 billion Euros in principal amount of foreign currency denominated\ndebt designated as non-derivative hedging instruments in certain net investment hedges as discussed in Note 12 in the “Net Investment\nHedges” section.\n \nInterest Rates Risk:\n \nThe Company may be impacted by interest rate volatility with respect to existing debt and future debt issuances. 3M manages interest\nexpense using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. To help manage borrowing costs, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps that\nare designated and qualify as fair value hedges. Under these arrangements, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the\ndifference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. The dollar\nequivalent (based on inception date foreign currency exchange rates) gross notional amount of the Company’s interest rate swaps at\nDecember 31, 2015 was $1.8 billion. Additional details about 3M’s long-term debt can be found in Note 10, including references to\ninformation regarding derivatives and/or hedging instruments associated with the Company’s long-term debt.\n \n45\n \nTable of Contents \nCommodity Prices Risk:\n \nThe Company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and forward contracts. 3M\nused commodity price swaps as cash flow hedges of forecasted commodity transactions to manage price volatility, but discontinued this\npractice in the first quarter of 2015. The related mark-to-market gain or loss on qualifying hedges was included in other comprehensive\nincome to the extent effective, and reclassified into cost of sales in the period during which the hedged transaction affected earnings.\n \nValue At Risk:\n \nThe value at risk analysis is performed annuall\n\n--------------------------------\nAnd here is your task:\n\nExtract the exact figure (in millions) for \'Total Revenue\' or \'Net Sales\' for the year 2014.

A Monte Carlo simulation technique was used to test the impact on after-tax earnings related to financial instruments\n(primarily debt), derivatives and underlying exposures outstanding at December 31, 2015. The model (third-party bank dataset) used a 95\npercent confidence level over a 12-month time horizon. The exposure to changes in currency rates model used 18 currencies, interest rates\nrelated to three currencies, and commodity prices related to five commodities. This model does not purport to represent what actually will be\nexperienced by the Company. This model does not include certain hedge transactions, because the Company believes their inclusion would\nnot materially impact the results. The risk of loss or benefit associated with exchange rates was higher in 2015 due to a greater mix of\nfloating rate debt and a rising interest rate environment in the U.S. Interest rate volatility increased in 2015, based on a higher mix of\nfloating rate debt and the use of forward rates.

This estimate includes the effect of translating profits from local\ncurrencies into U.S. dollars; the impact of currency fluctuations on the transfer of goods between 3M operations in the United States and\nabroad; and transaction gains and losses, including derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks and the\nnegative impact of swapping Venezuelan bolivars into U.S. dollars. 3M estimates that year-on-year derivative and other transaction gains\nand losses had the following effects on pre-tax income: 2015 ($180 million increase) and 2014 ($10 million increase).\n \nAn analysis of the global exposures related to purchased components and materials is performed at each year-end. A one percent price\nchange would result in a pre-tax cost or savings of approximately $70 million per year. The global energy exposure is such that a ten percent\nprice change would result in a pre-tax cost or savings of approximately $40 million per year. Global energy exposure includes energy costs\nused in 3M production and other facilities, primarily electricity and natural gas.\n46\n \nTable of Contents \nItem 8.

The financial statements\nhave been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Where necessary, the\nfinancial statements reflect estimates based on management’s judgment.\n \nManagement has established and maintains a system of internal control over financial reporting for the Company and its subsidiaries. This\nsystem and its established accounting procedures and related controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are\nsafeguarded, that the books and records properly reflect all transactions, that policies and procedures are implemented by qualified\npersonnel, and that published financial statements are properly prepared and fairly presented. The Company’s system of internal control\nover financial reporting is supported by widely communicated written policies, including business conduct policies, which are designed to\nrequire all employees to maintain high ethical standards in the conduct of Company affairs. Internal auditors continually review the\naccounting and control system.\n \n3M Company\n \nManagement’s Report  on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n \nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting. Management\nconducted an assessment of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established by the Committee\nof Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013).  Management’s assessment\nof the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 excluded Capital Safety Group\nS.A.R.L. and Polypore International, Inc.’s Separation Media Business, which were both acquired by the Company in August 2015 in\npurchase business combinations. These acquired businesses’ total assets and total net sales, in the aggregate, represented less than 2 percent\nand less than 1 percent, respectively, of the Company’s consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31,\n2015. Companies are allowed to exclude acquisitions from their assessment of internal control over financial reporting during the first year\nof acquisition while integrating the acquired company under guidelines established by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Based on\nthe assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2015, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective.\n \nThe Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an\nindependent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein, which expresses an unqualified opinion on\nthe effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015.\n \n3M Company\n48\n \nTable of Contents \nReport  of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n \nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors of 3M Company\n \nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of\n3M Company and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) at December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of\nthe three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica.  Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,\n2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (COSO).  The Company\'s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control\nover financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying\nManagement\'s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.  Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the\nCompany\'s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the\nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was\nmaintained in all material respects.  Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and\ndisclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the\noverall financial statement presentation.  Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control\nover financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exist\n\n--------------------------------\nAnd here is your task:\n\nExtract the exact figure (in millions) for \'Total Revenue\' or \'Net Sales\' for the year 2014.

Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We\nbelieve that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n \nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for marketable securities and\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities in 2015.\n \nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial\nreporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company’s\ninternal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are\nrecorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and\nexpenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a\nmaterial effect on the financial statements.\n \nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any\nevaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the\ndegree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n \nAs described in Management\'s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded Capital Safety Group S.A.R.L. (“Capital\nSafety”) and Polypore International, Inc.’s Separations Media Business (“Polypore Separations Media”) from its assessment of internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of December 31, 2015 because these businesses were acquired by the Company in purchase business combinations during\n2015.  We have also excluded Capital Safety and Polypore Separations Media from our audit of internal control over financial reporting.  Capital Safety\nis a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and the Company acquired the assets and liabilities of Polypore Separations Media whose total assets and\ntotal net sales, in the aggregate, represent less than 2 percent and less than 1 percent, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement\namounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015.\n \n/s/

Significant Accounting Policies \n \nConsolidation: 3M is a diversified global manufacturer, technology innovator and marketer of a wide variety of products. All subsidiaries\nare consolidated. All intercompany transactions are eliminated. As used herein, the term “3M” or “Company” refers to 3M Company and\nsubsidiaries unless the context indicates otherwise.\n \nBasis of presentation: Certain balances relative to prior periods have been reclassified to conform to December 31, 2015 presentation in\nconnection with the following, each of which is further discussed in the indicated section of Note 1:\n·\nChange in method of classification of certain marketable securities previously classified as non-current to current as further\ndiscussed in the Marketable securities section; and\n·\nAdoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, and ASU\nNo. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, in the fourth quarter of 2015 on a retrospective basis as further\ndiscussed in the New Accounting Pronouncements section.\n \nForeign currency translation: Local currencies generally are considered the functional currencies outside the United States. Assets and\nliabilities for operations in local-currency environments are translated at month-end exchange rates of the period reported. Income and\nexpense items are translated at month-end exchange rates of each applicable month. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded as a\ncomponent of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders’ equity.\n \nAlthough local currencies are typically considered as the functional currencies outside the United States, under Accounting Standards\nCodification (ASC) 830, Foreign Currency Matters, the reporting currency of a foreign entity’s parent is assumed to be that entity’s\nfunctional currency when the economic environment of a foreign entity is highly inflationary—generally when its cumulative inflation is\napproximately 100 percent or more for the three years that precede the beginning of a reporting period. 3M has a subsidiary in Venezuela\nwith operating income representing less than 1.0 percent of 3M’s consolidated operating income for 2015. Since January 1, 2010, the\nfinancial statements of the Venezuelan subsidiary have been remeasured as if its functional currency were that of its parent.\n \nThe Venezuelan government sets official rates of exchange and conditions precedent to purchase foreign currency at these rates with local\ncurrency. Such rates and conditions have been and continue to be subject to change. In January 2014, the Venezuelan government\nannounced that the National Center for Foreign Commerce (CENCOEX), had assumed the role with respect to the continuation of the\nexisting official exchange rate, significantly expanded the use of a second currency auction exchange mechanism called the Complementary\nSystem for Foreign Currency Acquirement (or SICAD1), and issued exchange regulations indicating the SICAD1 rate of exchange would\nbe used for payments related to international investments. In late March 2014, the Venezuelan government launched a third foreign\nexchange mechanism, SICAD2, which it later replaced with another foreign currency exchange platform in February 2015 called the\nMarginal System of Foreign Currency (SIMADI). The SIMADI rate was described as being derived from daily private bidders and buyers\nexchanging offers through authorized agents. This rate is approved and published by the Venezuelan Central Bank.\n \nThe financial statements of 3M’s Venezuelan subsidiary were remeasured utilizing the official CENCOEX (or its predecessor) rate into\nMarch 2014, the SICAD1 rate beginning in late March 2014, the SICAD2 rate beginning in June 2014, and the SIMADI rate beginning in\nFebruary 2015. 3M’s uses of these rates were based upon evaluation of a number of factors including, but not limited to, the exchange rate\nthe Company’s Venezuelan subsidiary may legally use to convert currency, settle transactions or pay dividends; the probability of accessing\nand obtaining currency by use of a particular rate or mechanism; and the Company’s intent and ability to use a particular exchange\nmechanism. Other factors notwithstanding, remeasurement impacts of the changes in use of these exchange rates did not have material\nimpacts on 3M’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition.\n \nThe Company continues to monitor circumstances relative to its Venezuelan subsidiary. \n\n--------------------------------\nAnd here is your task:\n\nExtract the exact figure (in millions) for \'Total Revenue\' or \'Net Sales\' for the year 2014.

Changes in applicable exchange rates or exchange\nmechanisms may continue in the future. These changes could impact the rate of exchange applicable to remeasure the Company’s net\nmonetary assets (liabilities) denominated in Venezuelan Bolivars (VEF). As of\n55\n \nTable of Contents \nDecember 31, 2015, the Company had a balance of net monetary liabilities denominated in VEF of less than 500 million VEF and the\nCENCOEX, SICAD (formerly SICAD1), and SIMADI exchange rates were approximately 6 VEF, 13 VEF, and 200 VEF per U.S. dollar,\nrespectively.\n \nA need to deconsolidate the Company’s Venezuelan subsidiary’s operations may result from a lack of exchangeability of VEF-denominated\ncash coupled with an acute degradation in the ability to make key operational decisions due to government regulations in Venezuela. 3M\nmonitors factors such as its ability to access various exchange mechanisms; the impact of government regulations on the Company’s ability\nto manage its Venezuelan subsidiary’s capital structure, purchasing, product pricing, and labor relations; and the current political and\neconomic situation within Venezuela. Based upon such factors as of December 31, 2015, the Company continues to consolidate its\nVenezuelan subsidiary. As of December 31, 2015, the balance of intercompany receivables due from this subsidiary and its equity balance\nare not significant.\n \nReclassifications: Certain amounts in the prior years’ consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year\npresentation.\n \nUse of estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent\nassets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.\nActual results could differ from these estimates.\n \nCash and cash equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and temporary investments with maturities of three months or less\nwhen acquired.\n \nMarketable securities: Effective December 31, 2015, the Company changed the method of classification of certain securities previously\nclassified as non-current to current. This new method classifies these securities as current or non-current based on the nature of the securities\nand availability for use in current operations while the prior classification was based on management’s intended holding period, the\nsecurity’s maturity date and liquidity considerations based on market conditions. The Company believes this method is preferable because it\nis consistent with how the Company manages its capital structure and liquidity. The prior period balance has been reclassified to conform to\nthe current year presentation:\n \n \nDecember 31, 2014\n \n(Millions)\n    Previously Reported     \nImpact\n    \nAs Adjusted\n \nMarketable securities - current\n $\n626  $\n813  $\n1,439  \nMarketable securities - non-current\n  \n828   \n(813)  \n15  \nTotal marketable securities\n $\n1,454  $\n —  $\n1,454  \n \n3M reviews impairments associated with its marketable securities in accordance with the measurement guidance provided by ASC\n320, Investments-Debt and Equity Securities, when determining the classification of the impairment as “temporary” or “other-than-\ntemporary”. A temporary impairment charge results in an unrealized loss being recorded in the other comprehensive income component of\nshareholders’ equity. Such an unrealized loss does not reduce net income for the applicable accounting period because the loss is not viewed\nas other-than-temporary. The factors evaluated to differentiate between temporary and other-than-temporary include the projected future\ncash flows, credit ratings actions, and assessment of the credit quality of the underlying collateral, as well as other factors.\n \nInvestments: Investments primarily include equity method, cost method, and available-for-sale equity investments. Available-for-sale\ninvestments are recorded at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses relating to investments classified as available-for-sale are recorded as a\ncomponent of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders’ equity.\n \nOther assets: Other assets include deferred income taxes, product and other insurance receivables, the cash surrender value of life insurance\npolicies, and other long-term assets. Investments in life insurance are reported at the amount that could be realized under contract at the\nbalance sheet date, with any changes in cash surrender value or contract value during the period accounted for as an adjustment of premiums\npaid. Cash outflows and inflows associated with life\n56\n \nTable of Contents \ninsurance activity are included in “Purchases of marketable securities and investments” and “Proceeds from maturities and sale of\nmarketable securities and investments,” respectively.\n \nInventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost generally determined on a first-in, first-out basis.\n \nProperty, plant and equipment: Property, plant and equipment, including capitalized interest and internal engineering costs, are recorded at\ncost. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment generally is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives\nof the assets. The estimated useful lives of buildings and improvements primarily range from ten to forty years, with the majority in the\nrange of twenty to forty years. The estimated useful lives of machinery and equipment primarily range from three to fifteen years, with the\nmajority in the range of five to ten years. Fully depreciated assets are retained in property and accumulated depreciation accounts until\ndisposal. Upon disposal, assets and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the net amount, less proceeds from\ndisposal, is charged or credited to operations. Property, plant and equipment amounts are reviewed for impairment whenever events or\nchanges in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be\nrecognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the\nasset and its eventual disposition. The amount of the impairment loss recorded is calculated by the excess of the asset’s carrying value over\nits fair value. Fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis.\n \nConditional asset retirement obligations: A liability is initially recorded at fair value for an asset retirement obligation associated with the\nretirement of tangible long-lived assets in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. Conditional\nasset retirement obligations exist for certain long-term assets of the Company. The obligation is initially measured at fair value using\nexpected present value techniques. Over time the liabilities are accreted for the change in their present value and the initial capitalized costs\nare depreciated over the remaining useful lives of the related assets. The asset retirement obligation liability was $102 million and $96\nmillion at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\n \nGoodwill: Goodwill is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a\nbusiness combination. Goodwill is not amortized. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year, and is tested\nfor impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired.\nImpairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level, with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. Reporting units are one level\nbelow the business segment level, but can be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic\ncharacteristics. 3M did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing. An impairment loss generally would be recognized\nwhen the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. The estimated fair value of\na reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a price/earnings ratio for comparable industry groups, or by\nusing a discounted cash flow analysis. Companies have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of a\nreporting unit is not “more likely than not” less than its carrying amount, which is commonly referred to as “Step 0”. 3M has chosen not to\napply Step 0 for 2015 or prior period annual goodwill assessments.\n \nIntangible assets: Intangible asset types include customer related, patents, other technology-based, tradenames and other intangible assets\nacquired from an independent party. Intangible assets with a definite life are amortized over a period ranging from one to twenty years on a\nsystematic and rational basis (generally straight line) that is representative of the asset’s use. The estimated useful lives vary by category,\nwith customer related largely between seven to seventeen years, patents largely between five to thirteen years, other technology-based\nlargely between two to fifteen years, definite lived tradenames largely between three and twenty years, and other intangibles largely\nbetween two to ten years. Costs related to internally developed intangible assets, such as patents, are expensed as incurred, primarily in\n“Research, development and related expenses.”\n \nIntangible assets with a definite life are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an\nasset (asset group) may not be recoverable.

The\n57\n \nTable of Contents \namount of the impairment loss recorded is calculated by the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value. Fair value is generally\ndetermined using a discounted cash flow analysis.\n \nIntangible assets with an indefinite life, namely certain tradenames, are not amortized. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for\nimpairment annually, and are tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that\nthe carrying amount may be impaired. An impairment loss generally would be recognized when the fair value is less than the carrying value\nof the indefinite-lived intangible asset.\n \nRestructuring actions: Restructuring actions generally include significant actions involving employee-related severance charges, contract\ntermination costs, and impairment or accelerated depreciation/amortization of assets associated with such actions. Employee-related\nseverance charges are largely based upon distributed employment policies and substantive severance plans. These charges are reflected in\nthe quarter when the actions are probable and the amounts are estimable, which typically is when management approves the associated\nactions. Severance amounts for which affected employees were required to render service in order to receive benefits at their termination\ndates were measured at the date such benefits were communicated to the applicable employees and recognized as expense over the\nemployees’ remaining service periods. Contract termination and other charges primarily reflect costs to terminate a contract before the end\nof its term (measured at fair value at the time the Company provided notice to the counterparty) or costs that will continue to be incurred\nunder the contract for its remaining term without economic benefit to the Company. Asset impairment charges related to intangible assets\nand property, plant and equipment reflect the excess of the assets’ carrying values over their fair values.\n \nRevenue (sales) recognition: The Company sells a wide range of products to a diversified base of customers around the world and has no\nmaterial concentration of credit risk. Revenue is recognized when the risks and rewards of ownership have substantively transferred to\ncustomers. This condition normally is met when the product has been delivered or upon performance of services. The Company records\nestimated reductions to revenue or records expense for customer and distributor incentives, primarily comprised of rebates and free goods, at\nthe time of the initial sale. These sales incentives are accounted for in accordance with ASC 605, Revenue Recognition. The estimated\nreductions of revenue for rebates are based on the sales terms, historical experience, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the\nvarious markets served. Since the Company serves numerous markets, the rebate programs offered vary across businesses, but the most\ncommon incentive relates to amounts paid or credited to customers for achieving defined volume levels or growth objectives. Free goods are\naccounted for as an expense and recorded in cost of sales. Sales, use, value-added and other excise taxes are not recognized in revenue.\n \nThe vast majority of 3M’s sales agreements are for standard products and services with customer acceptance occurring upon delivery of the\nproduct or performance of the service. However, to a limited extent 3M also enters into agreements that involve multiple elements (such as\nequipment, installation and service), software, or non-standard terms and conditions.\n \nFor non-software multiple-element arrangements, the Company recognizes revenue for delivered elements when they have stand-alone\nvalue to the customer, they have been accepted by the customer, and for which there are only customary refund or return rights.\nArrangement consideration is allocated to the deliverables by use of the relative selling price method. The selling price used for each\ndeliverable is based on vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) if available, third-party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available, or\nestimated selling price if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. Estimated selling price is determined in a manner consistent with that used to\nestablish the price to sell the deliverable on a standalone basis. In addition to the preceding conditions, equipment revenue is not recorded\nuntil the installation has been completed if equipment acceptance is dependent upon installation or if installation is essential to the\nfunctionality of the equipment. Installation revenues are not recorded until installation has been completed.\n \nFor arrangements (or portions of arrangements) falling within software revenue recognition standards and that do not involve significant\nproduction, modification, or customization, revenue for each software or software-related element is recognized when the Company has\nVSOE of the fair value of all of the undelivered elements and applicable criteria have been met for the delivered elements. When the\narrangements involve significant production, modification or customization, long-term construction-type accounting involving proportional\nperformance is generally employed.\n \n58\n \nTable of Contents \nFor prepaid service contracts, sales revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract, unless historical evidence\nindicates the costs are incurred on other than a straight-line basis. License fee revenue is recognized as earned, and no revenue is recognized\nuntil the inception of the license term.\n \nOn occasion, agreements will contain milestones, or 3M will recognize revenue based on proportional performance. For these agreements,\nand depending on the specifics, 3M may recognize revenue upon completion of a substantive milestone, or in proportion to costs incurred to\ndate compared with the estimate of total costs to be incurred.\n \nAccounts receivable and allowances: Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company\nmaintains allowances for bad debts, cash discounts, product returns and various other items. The allowance for doubtful accounts and\nproduct returns is based on the best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in existing accounts receivable and anticipated sales\nreturns. The Company determines the allowances based on historical write-off experience by industry and regional economic data and\nhistorical sales returns. The Company reviews the allowance for doubtful accounts monthly. The Company does not have any significant\noff-balance-sheet credit exposure related to its customers.\n \nAdvertising and merchandising: These costs are charged to operations in the period incurred, and totaled $368 million in 2015, $407 million\nin 2014 and $423 million in 2013.\n \nResearch, development and related expenses: These costs are charged to operations in the period incurred and are shown on a separate line\nof the Consolidated Statement of Income. Research, development and related expenses totaled $1.763 billion in 2015, $1.770 billion in 2014\nand $1.715 billion in 2013. Research and development expenses, covering basic scientific research and the application of scientific\nadvances in the development of new and improved products and their uses, totaled $1.223 billion in 2015, $1.193 billion in 2014 and $1.150\nbillion in 2013. Related expenses primarily include technical support; internally developed patent costs, which include costs and fees\nincurred to prepare, file, secure and maintain patents; amortization of externally acquired patents and externally acquired in-process research\nand development; and gains/losses associated with certain corporate approved investments in R&D-related ventures, such as equity method\neffects and impairments.\n \nInternal-use software: The Company capitalizes direct costs of services used in the development of internal-use software. Amounts\ncapitalized are amortized over a period of three to seven years, generally on a straight-line basis, unless another systematic and rational basis\nis more representative of the software’s use. Amounts are reported as a component of either machinery and equipment or capital leases\nwithin property, plant and equipment.\n \nEnvironmental: Environmental expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or\nfuture revenues are expensed. Reserves for liabilities related to anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when\nthey are probable and reasonably estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies, the Company’s commitment to a\nplan of action, or approval by regulatory agencies. Environmental expenditures for capital projects that contribute to current or future\noperations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.\n \nIncome taxes: The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach. Under this approach, deferred income\ntaxes represent the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and\nliabilities. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets when uncertainty regarding their realizability exists.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had valuation allowances of $31 million and $22 million on its deferred tax assets,\nrespectively. The increase in valuation allowance at December 31, 2015 relates to current acquisitions in certain international jurisdictions.\nThe Company recognizes and measures its uncertain tax positions based on the rules under ASC 740, Income Taxes.\n \nEarnings per share: The difference in the weighted average 3M shares outstanding for calculating basic and diluted earnings per share\nattributable to 3M common shareholders is the resul\n\n--------------------------------\nAnd here is your task:\n\nExtract the exact figure (in millions) for \'Total Revenue\' or \'Net Sales\' for the year 2014.

Under\napplicable accounting standards, the fair value of share-based compensation is determined at the grant date and the recognition of the related\nexpense is recorded over the period in which the share-based compensation vests. Refer to Note 15 for additional information.\n \nComprehensive income: Total comprehensive income and the components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are presented\nin the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity. Accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss) is composed of foreign currency translation effects (including hedges of net investments in international\ncompanies), defined benefit pension and postretirement plan adjustments, unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt and equity\nsecurities, and unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedging instruments.\n \nDerivatives and hedging activities: All derivative instruments within the scope of ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, are recorded on the\nbalance sheet at fair value. The Company uses interest rate swaps, currency and commodity price swaps, and foreign currency forward and\noption contracts to manage risks generally associated with foreign exchange rate, interest rate and commodity market volatility. All hedging\ninstruments that qualify for hedge accounting are designated and effective as hedges, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting\nprinciples. If the underlying hedged transaction ceases to exist, all changes in fair value of the related derivatives that have not been settled\nare recognized in current earnings. Instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are marked to market with changes recognized in\ncurrent earnings. Cash flows from derivative instruments are classified in the statement of cash flows in the same category as the cash flows\nfrom the items subject to designated hedge or undesignated (economic) hedge relationships. The Company does not hold or issue derivative\nfinancial instruments for trading purposes and is not a party to leveraged derivatives.\n \nCredit risk: The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties in interest rate swaps, currency swaps,\ncommodity price swaps, and forward and option contracts. However, the Company’s risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments. The\nCompany actively monitors its exposure to credit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit limits, and by selecting major\ninternational banks and financial institutions as counterparties. 3M enters into master netting arrangements with counterparties when\npossible to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions. A master netting arrangement may allow each counterparty to net settle amounts\nowed between a 3M entity and the counterparty as a result of multiple, separate derivative transactions. The Company does not anticipate\nnonperformance by any of these counterparties. 3M has elected to present the fair value of derivative assets and\n60\n \nTable of Contents \nliabilities within the Company’s consolidated balance sheet on a gross basis even when derivative transactions are subject to master netting\narrangements and may otherwise qualify for net presentation.\n \nFair value measurements: 3M follows ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, with respect to assets and liabilities that are\nmeasured at fair value on a recurring basis and nonrecurring basis. Under the standard, fair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount\nthat would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the\nmeasurement date. The standard also establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable\ninputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs\nare inputs market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent\nof the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions about the factors market participants would use in\nvaluing the asset or liability developed based upon the best information available in the circumstances. The hierarchy is broken down into\nthree levels. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs include quoted\nprices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not\nactive, and inputs (other than quoted prices) that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are\nunobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is\nsignificant to the fair value measurement.\n \nAcquisitions: The Company accounts for business acquisitions in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations.  This standard requires\nthe acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all (and only) the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction and\nestablishes the acquisition-date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business\ncombination. Certain provisions of this standard prescribe, among other things, the determination of acquisition-date fair value of\nconsideration paid in a business combination (including contingent consideration) and the exclusion of transaction and acquisition-related\nrestructuring costs from acquisition accounting.\n \nNew Accounting Pronouncements\n \nIn April 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2014-08, Reporting Discontinued Operations and\nDisclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity, which changed the criteria for determining which disposals can be presented as\ndiscontinued operations and modified related disclosure requirements. This standard has the impact of reducing the frequency of disposals\nreported as discontinued operations, by requiring such a disposal to represent a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on an\nentity’s operations and financial results. However, existing provisions that prohibited an entity from reporting a discontinued operation if it\nhad certain continuing cash flows or involvement with the component after disposal were eliminated by this standard. The ASU also\nexpands the disclosures for discontinued operations and requires new disclosures related to individually significant disposals that do not\nqualify as discontinued operations. For 3M, this ASU was effective prospectively beginning January 1, 2015. This ASU was applied to the\n2015 divestiture information discussed in Note 2 and had no material impact on consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\n \nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and in August 2015 issued ASU No. 2015-14,\nwhich amended ASU No. 2014-09 as to effective date. The ASU, as amended, provides a single comprehensive model to be used in the\naccounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-\nspecific guidance. The standard’s stated core principle is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or\nservices to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or\nservices. To achieve this core principle the ASU includes provisions within a five step model that includes identifying the contract with a\ncustomer, identifying the performance obligations in the contract, determining the transaction price, allocating the transaction price to the\nperformance obligations, and recognizing revenue when (or as) an entity satisfies a performance obligation. The standard also specifies the\naccounting for some costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer and requires expanded disclosures about revenue recognition.

For 3M, the ASU, as\n61\n \nTable of Contents \namended, is effective January 1, 2018. The Company is currently assessing this standard’s impact on 3M’s consolidated results of\noperations and financial condition.\n \nIn February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis, which changes guidance related to both\nthe variable interest entity (VIE) and voting interest entity (VOE) consolidation models. With respect to the VIE model, the standard\nchanges, among other things, the identification of variable interests associated with fees paid to a decision maker or service provider, the\nVIE characteristics for a limited partner or similar entity, and the primary beneficiary determination. With respect to the VOE model, the\nASU eliminates the presumption that a general partner controls a limited partnership or similar entity unless the presumption can otherwise\nbe overcome. Under the new guidance, a general partner would largely not consolidate a partnership or similar entity under the VOE model.\nFor 3M, this ASU is effective January 1, 2016, with early adoption permitted. 3M does not have significant involvement with entities\nsubject to consolidation considerations impacted by the VIE model changes or with limited partnerships potentially impacted by the VOE\nmodel changes. As a result, 3M does not expect this ASU to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\n   \nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, and in August 2015 issued ASU\nNo. 2015-15, Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements. Under ASU\n2015-03, debt issuance costs reported on the consolidated balance sheet would be reflected as a direct deduction from the related debt\nliability rather than as an asset. While ASU 2015-03 addresses costs related to term debt, ASU No. 2015-15 provides clarification regarding\ncosts to secure revolving lines of credit, which are, at the outset, not associated with an outstanding borrowing. ASU No. 2015-15 provides\ncommentary that the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting costs associated with line-of-credit arrangements as an\nasset and subsequently amortizing them ratably over the term of the revolving debt arrangement. For 3M, ASU No. 2015-03 is effective\nJanuary 1, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this ASU in the fourth quarter of 2015 with retrospective application\nto prior periods. As a result, debt issue costs aggregating $26 million previously included within Other Assets have been reflected as\nreductions in the balances of Long-Term Debt as of December 31, 2014.\n \nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-05, Customer’s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Arrangement, which requires a\ncustomer to determine whether a cloud computing arrangement contains a software license. If the arrangement contains a software license,\nthe customer would account for fees related to the software license element in a manner consistent with accounting for the acquisition of\nother acquired software licenses. If the arrangement does not contain a software license, the customer would account for the arrangement as\na service contract. An arrangement would contain a software license element if both (1) the customer has the contractual right to take\npossession of the software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and (2) it is feasible for the customer to either\nrun the software on its own hardware or contract with another party unrelated to the vendor to host the software. For 3M, this ASU is\neffective January 1, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The standard provides for adoption either fully retrospectively or prospectively to\narrangements entered into, or materially modified, after the effective date. The Company does not expect this ASU to have a material impact\non 3M’s consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\n \nIn May 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-07, Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share\n(or Its Equivalent). This standard modifies existing disclosure requirements such that investments for which the practical expedient is used\nto measure their fair value at net asset value (NAV) would be removed from the fair value hierarchy disclosures. Instead, an entity would be\nrequired to include those investments as a reconciling item such that the total fair value amount of investments in the fair value hierarchy\ndisclosure is consistent with the amount on the balance sheet. Changes were also made to the requirements in a sponsor’s employee benefit\nplan asset disclosures. For 3M, this standard is effective January 1, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this ASU in\nthe fourth quarter of 2015 with retrospective application to prior periods. As a result, Note 11, Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans,\nreflects the modified disclosures with respect to applicable plan assets. As this ASU only relates to certain disclosures, it did not impact the\nCompany’s consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\n \nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory, which modifies existing requirements\nregarding measuring inventory at the lower of cost or market. Under existing standards, the market amount requires consideration of\nreplacement cost, net realizable value (NRV), and NRV less an approximately normal profit\n62\n \nTable of Contents \nmargin. The new ASU replaces market with NRV, defined as estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably\npredictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. This eliminates the need to determine and consider replacement cost or NRV\nless an approximately normal profit margin when measuring inventory. For 3M, this standard is effective prospectively beginning January 1,\n2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing this ASU’s impacts on 3M’s consolidated results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\n   \nIn September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments, that eliminates\nthe requirement for an acquirer in a business combination to account for measurement-period adjustments retrospectively. Under existing\nstandards, an acquirer in a business combination reports provisional amounts with respect to acquired assets and liabilities when their\nmeasurements are incomplete as of the end of the reporting period. Prior to the impact of this ASU, an acquirer is required to adjust\nprovisional amounts (and the related impact on earnings) by restating prior period financial statements during the measurement period\nwhich cannot exceed one year from the date of acquisition. The new guidance requires that the cumulative impact of a measurement-period\nadjustment (including the impact on prior periods) be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment is identified—eliminating\nthe requirement to restate prior period financial statements. The new standard requires disclosure of the nature and amount of measurement-\nperiod adjustments as well as information with respect to the portion of the adjustments recorded in current-period earnings that would have\nbeen recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustments to provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. The\nASU is applied prospectively to measurement-period adjustments that occur after the effective date. For 3M, this standard is required\nprospectively beginning January 1, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this standard with respect to measurement-\nperiod adjustments beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015. Additional disclosure, as applicable, is included in Note 2, Acquisitions and\nDivestitures.\n \nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which requires entities to present\ndeferred tax assets (DTAs) and deferred tax liabilities (DTLs), along with any related valuation allowance, as noncurrent in a balance sheet.\nThis ASU eliminates current guidance requiring deferred taxes for each jurisdiction to be presented as a net current asset or liability and a\nnet noncurrent asset or liability. As a result, each jurisdiction would have one net noncurrent DTA or DTL balance. The ASU does not\nchange the existing requirement that only permits offsetting DTAs and DTLs within a particular jurisdiction. For 3M, this standard is\neffective January 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted. In light of the process simplification provided by this ASU, the Company adopted\nthis standard in the fourth quarter of 2015 with retrospective application to prior periods. As a result, the December 31, 2014 balances of\nDTAs and DTLs previously reported were impacted as follows:\n \n \nDecember 31, 2014\n \n(Millions)\n    Previously Reported     \nImpact\n    \nAs Adopted\n \nPrepaid expenses and other (within other current assets)\n $\n595  $\n169  $\n764  \nOther current tax assets (within other current assets)\n \n \n444   \n(444)  \n —  \nDeferred tax assets (within other assets)\n  \n889   \n241   \n1,130  \nDeferred tax liabilities (within other current liabilities)\n \n \n34   \n(34)  \n —  \n \nIn conjunction with the adoption of this ASU, 3M reclassified $169 million of remaining other current tax assets to prepaid expenses and\nother to conform to the 2015 presentation.\n \nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which\nrevises the accounting related to (1) the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and (2) the presentation of certain\nfair value changes for fin\n\n--------------------------------\nAnd here is your task:\n\nExtract the exact figure (in millions) for \'Total Revenue\' or \'Net Sales\' for the year 2014.

The ASU also amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the\nfair value of financial instruments. The new guidance requires the fair value measurement of investments in equity securities and other\nownership interests in an entity, including investments in partnerships, unincorporated joint ventures and limited liability companies\n(collectively, equity securities) that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method. Entities will need to\nmeasure these investments and recognize changes in fair value in net income. Entities will no longer be able to recognize unrealized holding\ngains and losses on equity securities they classify under current guidance as available for sale in other comprehensive income (OCI). They\nalso will no longer be able to use the cost method of accounting for equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values.\nInstead, for these types of equity investments that do not otherwise qualify for the net asset value practical expedient, entities will be\npermitted to elect a practicability exception and\n63\n \nTable of Contents \nmeasure the investment at cost less impairment plus or minus observable price changes (in orderly transactions). The ASU also establishes\nan incremental recognition and disclosure requirement related to the presentation of fair value changes of financial liabilities for which the\nfair value option (FVO) has been elected. Under this guidance, an entity would be required to separately present in OCI the portion of the\ntotal fair value change attributable to instrument-specific credit risk as opposed to reflecting the entire amount in earnings. For derivative\nliabilities for which the FVO has been elected, however, any changes in fair value attributable to instrument-specific credit risk would\ncontinue to be presented in net income, which is consistent with current guidance. For 3M, this standard is effective beginning January 1,\n2018 via a cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings, except for guidance relative to equity securities without readily\ndeterminable fair values which is applied prospectively. The Company is currently assessing this ASU’s impacts on 3M’s consolidated\nresults of operations and financial condition.\n \n NOTE 2.

The allocation of purchase\nconsideration related to the August 2015 Capital Safety and Polypore Separations Media acquisitions is considered preliminary, primarily\nwith respect to certain tax-related assets and liabilities. 3M expects to finalize the allocation of purchase price within the one year\nmeasurement-period following these acquisitions. Adjustments to preliminary allocations primarily related to the identification and\nvaluation of certain indefinite-lived intangible assets (further discussed below).

Because 3M\nalready had a controlling interest in this consolidated subsidiary, this transaction was separately recorded as a financing activity in the\nstatement of cash flows.\n \nThere were no acquisitions that closed during 2013.\n \nGoodwill resulting from business combinations is largely attributable to the existing workforce of the acquired businesses and synergies\nexpected to arise after 3M’s acquisition of these businesses. Pro forma information related to acquisitions was not included because the\nimpact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations was not considered to be material.\n \nIn addition to business combinations, 3M periodically acquires certain tangible and/or intangible assets and purchases interests in certain\nenterprises that do not otherwise qualify for accounting as business combinations. These transactions are largely reflected as additional asset\npurchase and investment activity.\n \n2015 acquisitions:\n \nIn March 2015, 3M (Health Care Business) purchased all of the outstanding shares of Ivera Medical Corp., headquartered in San Diego,\nCalifornia. Ivera Medical Corp. is a manufacturer of health care products that disinfect and protect devices used for access into a patient’s\nbloodstream. In addition, in the first quarter of 2015, 3M (Industrial Business) purchased the remaining interest in a former equity method\ninvestment for an immaterial amount.\n \nIn August 2015, 3M (Safety and Graphics Business) acquired all of the outstanding shares of Capital Safety Group S.A.R.L., with operating\nheadquarters in Bloomington, Minnesota, from KKR & Co. L.P. for $1.7 billion, net of cash acquired. The net assets acquired included the\nassumption of $0.8 billion of debt. Capital Safety is a leading global provider of fall protection equipment.\n \nIn August 2015, 3M (Industrial Business) acquired the assets and liabilities associated with Polypore International, Inc.’s Separations Media\nbusiness, headquartered in Wuppertal, Germany, for $1.0 billion. Polypore’s Separations Media business is a leading provider of\nmicroporous membranes and modules for filtration in the life sciences, industrial and specialty segments.\n \nPurchased identifiable finite-lived intangible assets related to acquisition activity in 2015 totaled $1.0 billion. The associated finite-lived\nintangible assets acquired in 2015 will be amortized on a systematic and rational basis (generally straight line) over a weighted-average life\nof 14 years (lives ranging from two to 20 years). Indefinite-lived intangible assets of $520 million relate to certain tradenames associated\nwith the Capital Safety acquisition which have been in existence for over 55 years, have a history of leading market-share positions, have\nbeen and are intended to be continuously renewed, and the associated products of which are expected to generate cash flows for 3M for an\nindefinite period of time. Acquired in-process research and development and identifiable intangible assets for which significant assumed\nrenewals or extensions of underlying arrangements impacted the determination of their useful lives were not material.\n \n2014 acquisitions:\n \nDuring 2014, 3M completed one business combination. The purchase price paid for this business combination (net of cash acquired) and the\nimpact of other matters (net) during 2014 aggregated to $94 million.\n \nIn April 2014, 3M (Health Care Business) purchased all of the outstanding equity interests of Treo Solutions LLC, headquartered in Troy,\nNew York. Treo Solutions LLC is a provider of data analytics and business intelligence to healthcare payers and providers.\n \n65\n \nTable of Contents \nPurchased identifiable finite-lived intangible assets related to acquisition activity in 2014 totaled $34 million. The associated finite-lived\nintangible assets acquired in 2014 will be amortized on a systematic and rational basis (generally straight line) over a weighted-average life\nof six years (lives ranging from three to 10 years).

Upon completion of the transaction, 3M owned 100 percent of\nSumitomo 3M Limited.

This sale of shares complied with an amendment to Indian securities\nregulations that required 3M India Limited, as a listed company, to achieve a minimum public shareholding of at least 25 percent. As a\nresult of this transaction, 3M’s ownership in 3M India Limited was reduced from 76 percent to 75 percent.

As a result of this transaction, in the third quarter of\n2013, 3M recorded a pre-tax gain of $18 million in its Health Care business segment. In October 2013, cash was received for the\nnote receivable and is reflected in other investing activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December\n31, 2013.\n \n·\nDuring the second quarter of 2013, the Company’s Sumitomo 3M Limited subsidiary moved its administrative headquarters to a\nnew leased location and sold the former site under an installment sale arrangement. As a result, at the time of the closing of the\nsale transaction, the Company received certain cash proceeds (included in proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment in\nthe consolidated statement of cash flows) and recorded a note receivable (due in quarterly installments through the first quarter of\n2016) of $78 million and deferred profit of $49 million (both based on the foreign currency exchange rate at the time of closing).\nRemaining quarterly installments are due through the first quarter of 2016 and will be included in other investing activities in the\nconsolidated statement of cash flows. Deferred profit is reduced and recognized into income in connection with such quarterly\ninstallments.\n \nIn addition, as discussed in Note 6, in the fourth quarter of 2014, 3M’s Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2015 dividend of $1.025\nper share (paid in March 2015), which reduced 3M’s stockholders equity and increased other current liabilities as of December 2014 by\n$648 million. In the fourth quarter of 2013, 3M’s Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2014 dividend of $0.855 per share (paid in\nMarch 2014).

See\nNote 5 “Supplemental Balance Sheet Information” for further details.\n \nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company had tax effected operating losses, capital losses, and tax credit carryovers for federal\n(approximately $31 million), state (approximately $2 million), and international (approximately $76 million), with all amounts before\nvaluation allowances. The federal tax attribute carryovers will expire after 15 to 20 years, the state after five to 10 years, and the majority of\ninternational after four years with the remaining international expiring in one year or with an indefinite carryover period. The tax attributes\nbeing carried over arise as certain jurisdictions may have tax losses or may have inabilities to utilize certain losses without the same type of\ntaxable income. As of December 31, 2015, the Company has provided $31 million of valuation allowance against certain of these deferred\ntax assets based on management’s determination that it is more-likely-than-not that the tax benefits related to these assets will not be\nrealized.\n \n74\n \nTable of Contents \nReconciliation of Effective Income Tax Rate\n \n \n    \n2015\n    \n2014\n    \n2013\n \nStatutory U.S. tax rate\n \n35.0 %  \n35.0 %  \n35.0 %\nState income taxes - net of federal benefit\n \n1.1  \n0.9  \n0.9  \nInternational income taxes - net\n \n(3.8) \n(5.8) \n(6.3) \nU.S. research and development credit\n \n(0.5) \n(0.4) \n(0.7) \nReserves for tax contingencies\n \n(1.0) \n0.6  \n1.2  \nDomestic Manufacturer’s deduction\n \n(1.8) \n(1.3) \n(1.6) \nAll other - net\n \n0.1  \n(0.1) \n(0.4) \nEffective worldwide tax rate\n \n29.1 %  \n28.9 %  \n28.1 %\n \nThe effective tax rate for 2015 was 29.1 percent, compared to 28.9 percent in 2014, an increase of 0.2 percentage points, impacted by several\nfactors. Factors which increased the Company’s effective tax rate included international taxes, which were impacted by changes in foreign\ncurrency rates and changes to the geographic mix of income before taxes, and other items. Combined, these factors increased the\nCompany’s effective tax rate by 2.4 percentage points. This increase was partially offset by a 2.2 percentage point decrease, which related to\nthe remeasurements of 3M’s uncertain tax positions, including the restoration of tax basis on certain assets for which depreciation\ndeductions were previously limited, and increases in the domestic manufacturer’s deduction and U.S. research and development credit\nbenefits.\n \nThe effective tax rate for 2014 was 28.9 percent, compared to 28.1 percent in 2013, an increase of 0.8 percentage points, impacted by many\nfactors. Factors which increased the Company’s effective tax rate included a one-time international tax impact related to the establishment\nof the supply chain center of expertise in Europe, decreased U.S. research and development credit in 2014 compared to 2013 due to two\nyears inclusion as a result of the reinstatement in 2013, decreased domestic manufacturer’s deduction, and other items. Combined, these\nfactors increased the Company’s effective tax rate by 1.6 percentage points. This increase was partially offset by a 0.8 percentage point\ndecrease, which related to both lower 3M income tax reserves for 2014 when compared to 2013 and international taxes as a result of changes\nto the geographic mix of income before taxes.\n \nThe Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various states and foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the\nCompany is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2005.\n \nThe IRS has completed its field examination of the Company’s U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 2005 through 2013. The\nCompany protested certain IRS positions within these tax years and entered into the administrative appeals process with the IRS. In\nDecember 2012, the Company received a statutory notice of deficiency for the 2006 year. The Company filed a petition in Tax Court in the\nfirst quarter of 2013 relating to the 2006 tax year. Currently, the Company is under examination by the IRS for its U.S. federal income tax\nreturns for the years 2014 and 2015. It is anticipated that the IRS will complete its examination of the Company for 2014 by the end of the\nfirst quarter of 2016 and for 2015 by the end of the first quarter of 2017. As of December 31, 2015, the IRS has not proposed any significant\nadjustments to the Company’s tax positions for which the Company is not adequately reserved.\n \nPayments relating to other proposed assessments arising from the 2005 through 2015 examinations may not be made until a final agreement\nis reached between the Company and the IRS on such assessments or upon a final resolution resulting from the administrative appeals\nprocess or judicial action. In addition to the U.S. federal examination, there is also audit activity in several U.S. state and foreign\njurisdictions.\n \n3M anticipates changes to the Company’s uncertain tax positions due to the closing and resolution of audit issues for various audit years\nmentioned above and closure of statutes. The Company is not currently able to reasonably estimate the amount by which the liability for\nunrecognized tax benefits will increase or decrease during the next 12 months as a result of the ongoing income tax authority examinations.\n \n75\n \nTable of Contents \nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits (UTB) is as follows:\n \nFederal, State and Foreign Tax\n \n(Millions)\n    \n2015\n    \n2014\n    \n2013\n \nGross UTB Balance at January 1\n $\n583  $\n659  $\n528  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nAdditions based on tax positions related to the current year\n \n \n77  \n \n201  \n \n97  \nAdditions for tax positions of prior years\n \n \n140  \n \n30  \n \n158  \nRed\n\n--------------------------------\nAnd here is your task:\n\nExtract the exact figure (in millions) for \'Total Revenue\' or \'Net Sales\' for the year 2014.

The ending net UTB results from adjusting the gross balance for items such\nas Federal, State, and non-U.S. deferred items, interest and penalties, and deductible taxes. The net UTB is included as components of Other\nAssets, Accrued Income Taxes, and Other Liabilities within the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n \nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in tax expense. The Company recognized in the\nconsolidated statement of income on a gross basis approximately $2 million of expense, $14 million of benefit, and $22 million of expense\nin 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. The amount of interest and penalties recognized may be an expense or benefit due to new or\nremeasured unrecognized tax benefit accruals. At December 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014, accrued interest and penalties in the\nconsolidated balance sheet on a gross basis were $45 million and $44 million, respectively. Included in these interest and penalty amounts\nare interest and penalties related to tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about\nthe timing of such deductibility. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting, other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of the\nshorter deductibility period would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority to\nan earlier period.\n \nAs a result of certain employment commitments and capital investments made by 3M, income from certain manufacturing activities in the\nfollowing countries is subject to reduced tax rates or, in some cases, is exempt from tax for years through the following: Taiwan (2015),\nChina (2016), Korea (2018), Brazil (2023), Switzerland (2024), and Singapore (2025). The income tax benefits attributable to the tax status\nof these subsidiaries are estimated to be $114 million (18 cents per diluted share) in 2015, $99 million (15 cents per diluted share) in 2014,\nand $87 million (13 cents per diluted share) in 2013.\n \nThe Company has not provided deferred taxes on unremitted earnings attributable to international companies that have been considered to\nbe reinvested indefinitely, with the exception of an acquired entity. These earnings relate to ongoing operations and were approximately $12\nbillion as of December 31, 2015. Because of the availability of U.S. foreign tax credits, the multiple avenues in which to repatriate the\nearnings to minimize tax cost, and because a large portion of these earnings are not liquid, it is not practical to determine the income tax\nliability that would be payable if such earnings were not reinvested indefinitely.\n \n76\n \nTable of Contents \n \nNOTE 9.

At December 31, 2015 and 2014, gross unrealized gains and/or losses (pre-tax) were not material. Refer to Note 6 for a table that\nprovides the net realized gains (losses) related to sales or impairments of debt and equity securities, which includes marketable securities.\nThe gross amounts of the realized gains or losses were not material. Cost of securities sold use the first in, first out (FIFO) method. Since\nthese marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale securities, changes in fair value will flow through other comprehensive\nincome, with amounts reclassified out of other comprehensive income into earnings upon sale or “other-than-temporary” impairment.\n \n3M reviews impairments associated with its marketable securities in accordance with the measurement guidance provided by ASC\n320, Investments-Debt and Equity Securities, when determining the classification of the impairment as “temporary” or “other-than-\ntemporary”. A temporary impairment charge results in an unrealized loss being recorded in the other comprehensive income component of\nshareholders’ equity. Such an unrealized loss does not reduce net income attributable to 3M for the applicable accounting period because the\nloss is not viewed as other-than-temporary. The factors evaluated to differentiate between temporary and other-than-temporary include the\nprojected future cash flows, credit ratings actions, and assessment of the credit quality of the underlying collateral, as well as other factors.\n \n77\n \nTable of Contents \nThe balance at December 31, 2015, for marketable securities by contractual maturity are shown below.

Within this portfolio, current asset-backed\nsecurities (estimated fair value of $57 million) primarily include interests in automobile loans, credit cards and equipment leases. 3M’s\ninvestment policy allows investments in asset-backed securities with minimum credit ratings of Aa2 by Moody’s Investors Service or AA\nby Standard & Poor’s or Fitch Ratings or DBRS. Asset-backed securities must be rated by at least two of the aforementioned rating\nagencies, one of which must be Moody’s Investors Service or Standard & Poor’s. At December 31, 2015, all asset-backed security\ninvestments were in compliance with this policy. Approximately 75.8 percent of all asset-backed security investments were rated AAA or A-\n1+ by Standard & Poor’s and/or Aaa or P-1 by Moody’s Investors Service and/or AAA or F1+ by Fitch Ratings. Interest rate risk and credit\nrisk related to the underlying collateral may impact the value of investments in asset-backed securities, while factors such as general\nconditions in the overall credit market and the nature of the underlying collateral may affect the liquidity of investments in asset-backed\nsecurities. 3M does not currently expect risk related to its holding in asset-backed securities to materially impact its financial condition or\nliquidity.\n \n \n78\n \nTable of Contents \nNOTE 10.

This credit agreement includes a provision under which 3M may request an increase of up to $2.25 billion,\nbringing the total facility up to $4.5 billion (at the lender’s discretion). This facility was undrawn at December 31, 2015. Under the $2.25\nbillion credit agreement, the Company is required to maintain its EBITDA to Interest Ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter at not less\nthan 3.0 to 1. This is calculated (as defined in the agreement) as the ratio of consolidated total EBITDA for the four consecutive quarters\nthen ended to total interest expense on all funded debt for the same period. At December 31, 2015, this ratio was approximately 56 to 1. Debt\ncovenants do not restrict the payment of dividends.\n \nOther Credit Facilities\n \nApart from the committed revolving facility, an additional $241 million in stand-alone letters of credit and $18 million in bank guarantees\nwere also issued and outstanding at December 31, 2015. These lines of credit are utilized in connection with normal business activities.\n \nLong-Term Debt Issuances\n \nThe principal amounts, interest rates and maturity dates of individual long-term debt issuances can be found in the long-term debt table\nfound at the beginning of this note.\n \nIn May 2015, 3M issued 1.750 billion Euros aggregate principal amount of medium term notes. In August 2015, 3M issued $1.500 billion\naggregate principal amount of medium-term notes. Upon debt issuance, the Company entered into two interest rate swaps as fair value\nhedges of a portion of the fixed interest rate medium-term note obligation. The first converted a $450 million three-year fixed rate note, and\nthe second converted $300 million of a five-year fixed rate note included in this issuance to an interest rate based on a floating three-month\nLIBOR index.\n \nIn June 2014, 3M issued $950 million aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes. Upon debt issuance, the Company entered into an\ninterest rate swap to convert $600 million of a $625 million note included in this issuance to an interest rate based on a floating three-month\nLIBOR index as a fair value hedge of a portion of the fixed interest rate medium-term note obligation. In November 2014, the Company\nissued 1.250 billion Euros aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes.\n \nIn November 2013, 3M issued a Eurobond for an amount of 600 million Euros. Upon debt issuance, 3M completed a fixed-to-floating\ninterest rate swap on a notional amount of 300 million Euros.\n \n80\n \nTable of Contents \nLong-Term Debt Maturities\n \nIn July 2014, 3M retired at maturity 1.025 billion Euros of seven-year 5.0% fixed rate Eurobonds. In December 2012, 3M entered into a\nthree-year 66 million British Pound (approximately $106 million based on agreement date exchange rates) committed credit facility\nagreement with JP Morgan Chase Bank, which was fully drawn as of December 31, 2012. 3M repaid the balance in 2014.\n \nIn August 2013, 3M repaid $850 million (principal amount) of medium-term notes.\n \nFloating Rate Notes\n \nAt various times, 3M has issued floating rate notes containing put provisions. 3M would be required to repurchase these securities at\nvarious prices ranging from 99 percent to 100 percent of par value according to the reduction schedules for each security. In December 2004,\n3M issued a forty-year $60 million floating rate note, with a rate based on a floating LIBOR index. Under the terms of this floating rate note\ndue in 2044, holders have an annual put feature at 100 percent of par value from 2014 and every anniversary thereafter until final maturity.\nUnder the terms of the floating rate notes due in 2027, 2040 and 2041, holders have put options that commence ten years from the date of\nissuance and each third anniversary thereafter until final maturity at prices ranging from 99 percent to 100 percent of par value. In 2008\nthrough 2015, 3M was required to repurchase an immaterial amount of principal on the aforementioned floating rate notes.\n \n NOTE 11.  Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans\n \n3M has company-sponsored retirement plans covering substantially all U.S. employees and many employees outside the United States. In\ntotal, 3M has over 80 defined benefit plans in 28 countries. Pension benefits associated with these plans generally are based on each\nparticipant’s years of service, compensation, and age at retirement or termination. The primary U.S. defined-benefit pension plan was closed\nto new participants effective January 1, 2009. The Company also provides certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for\nsubstantially all of its U.S. employees who reach retirement age while employed by the Company. Most international employees and\nretirees are covered by government health care programs. The cost of company-provided postretirement health care plans for international\nemployees is not material and is combined with U.S. amounts in the tables that follow.\n \nThe Company also sponsors employee savings plans under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. These plans are offered to\nsubstantially all regular U.S. employees. For eligible employees hired prior to January 1, 2009, employee 401(k) contributions of up to 6%\nof eligible compensation were matched in cash at rates of 60% or 75%, depending on the plan in which the employee participates.\nEmployees hired on or after January 1, 2009, received a cash match of 100% for employee 401(k) contributions of up to 6% of eligible\ncompensation and also received an employer retirement income account cash contribution of 3% of the participant’s total eligible\ncompensation. Beginning on January 1, 2016, for U.S. employees, the Company reduced its match on employee 401(k) contributions. For\neligible employees hired prior to January 1, 2009, employee 401(k) contributions of up to 5% of eligible compensation will be matched in\ncash at rates of 45% or 60%, depending on the plan in which the employee participates. Employees hired on or after January 1, 2009, will\nreceive a cash match of 100% for employee 401(k) contributions of up to 5% of eligible compensation and will also continue to receive an\nemployer retirement income account cash contribution of 3% of the participant’s total eligible compensation. All contributions are invested\nin a number of investment funds pursuant to the employees’ elections. Employer contributions to the U.S. defined contribution plans were\n$165 million, $153 million and $136 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 3M subsidiaries in various international countries also\nparticipate in defined contribution plans. Employer contributions to the international defined contribution plans were $77 million, $75\nmillion and $71 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\n \nThe Company has made deposits for its defined benefit plans with independent trustees. Trust funds and deposits with insurance companies\nare maintained to provide pension benefits to plan participants and their beneficiaries. There are no plan assets in the non-qualified plan due\nto its nature. For its U.S. postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans, the Company has set aside amounts at least equal to\nannual benefit payments with an independent trustee.\n \n81\n \nTable of Contents \n3M’s primary U.S. qualified defined benefit plan does not have a mandatory cash contribution because the Company has a significant credit\nbalance from previous discretionary contributions that can be applied to any Pension Protection Act funding requirements.\n \nAs a result o\n\n--------------------------------\nAnd here is your task:\n\nExtract the exact figure (in millions) for \'Total Revenue\' or \'Net Sales\' for the year 2014.

These changes became effective beginning January 1, 2013, for all Medicare eligible\nretirees and their Medicare eligible dependents and became effective beginning January 1, 2016, for all non-Medicare eligible retirees and\ntheir eligible dependents. In August 2015, 3M modified the 3M Retiree Welfare Benefit Plan postretirement medical benefit reducing the\nfuture benefit for participants not retired as of January 1, 2016. For participants retiring after January 1, 2016, the Retiree Medical Savings\nAccount (RMSA) is no longer credited with interest and the indexation on both the RMSA and the Medicare Health Reimbursement\nArrangement is reduced from 3 percent to 1.5 percent per year (for those employees who are eligible for these accounts). Also effective\nJanuary 1, 2016, 3M no longer offers 3M Retiree Health Care Accounts to new hires. Due to these changes the plan was re-measured in the\nthird quarter of 2015, resulting in a decrease to the projected benefit obligation liability of approximately $233 million, and a related\nincrease to shareholders’ equity, specifically accumulated other comprehensive income.\n \nIn the third quarter of 2014, former U.S. employees who have a pension benefit for which they have not begun receiving payment (term\nvested) were offered a lump sum payout of their pension benefit. As a result of this action, the projected benefit obligation (PBO) liability\nwas reduced in the fourth quarter of 2014 by approximately $270 million, with the actual cash payout of approximately the same amount\npaid from the plan’s assets in the fourth quarter of 2014. The PBO liability reduction was 34% of the term vested eligible PBO and a 2%\nreduction in the overall U.S. pension PBO liability based on the December 31, 2013, valuation. There was no pension expense impact as a\nresult of this action on 3M’s consolidated statement of income in 2014.\n \nIn the fourth quarter of 2014, 3M’s Board of Directors approved an amendment of the U.S. defined benefit pension plan to include a lump\nsum payment option for employees that have vested retirement benefits who commence their pension January 1, 2015, or later. This option\nis also available to vested employees who leave 3M before becoming eligible to retire at the time of termination. This change reduced 3M’s\nyear-end 2014 U.S. pension PBO liability by approximately $266 million.\n \nAs of December 31, 2014, the Company converted to the “RP 2014 Mortality Tables” and updated the mortality improvement scale it used\nfor calculating the year-end 2014 U.S. defined benefit pension annuitant and postretirement obligations and 2015 expense. The impact of\nthis change increased the year-end 2014 U.S. pension PBO by approximately $820 million and the U.S. accumulated postretirement benefit\nobligation by approximately $100 million.\n \nIn March 2015, 3M Japan modified the Japan Limited Defined Benefit Corporate Pension Plan (DBCPP). Beginning July 1, 2015, eligible\nemployees receive a company provided contribution match of 6.12% of their eligible salary to their defined contribution plan. Employees no\nlonger earn additional service towards their defined benefit pension plans after July 1, 2015, except for eligible salaries above the statutory\ndefined contribution limits. As a result of this plan modification, the Company re-measured the DBCPP, which resulted in a $17 million\npre-tax curtailment gain for the year ending December 31, 2015. In March 2015, 3M also received a favorable Internal Revenue Service tax\ndetermination letter to terminate a frozen defined benefit pension plan of one of 3M’s acquired subsidiaries. By the end of 2015, this plan\nmade final distributions of $16 million to participants. The Company also had other settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits\nand other items in 2015 aggregating to the amounts indicated in these components in the applicable tables that follow.\n \n3M was informed during the first quarter of 2009, that the general partners of WG Trading Company, in which 3M’s benefit plans hold\nlimited partnership interests, are the subject of a criminal investigation as well as civil proceedings by the SEC and CFTC (Commodity\nFutures Trading Commission). In March 2011, over the objections of 3M and six other limited partners of WG Trading Company, the\ndistrict court judge ruled in favor of the court appointed receiver’s proposed distribution plan (and in April 2013, the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the district court’s ruling). The benefit plan trustee holdings of WG Trading Company interests\nwere adjusted to reflect the decreased estimated fair market value, inclusive of estimated insurance proceeds, as of the annual measurement\ndates.\n82\n \nTable of Contents \nThe Company has insurance that it believes, based on what is currently known, will result in the probable recovery of a portion of the\ndecrease in original asset value. In the first quarter of 2014, 3M and certain 3M benefit plans filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the\nDistrict of Minnesota against five insurers seeking insurance coverage for the WG Trading Company claim. In September 2015, the court\nruled in favor of the defendant insurance companies on a motion for summary judgment and dismissed the lawsuit. In October 2015, 3M and\nthe 3M benefit plans filed a notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. As of the 2015 measurement date,\nthese holdings represented less than one half of one percent of 3M’s fair value of total plan assets. 3M currently believes that the resolution\nof these events will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of the Company.\n \nThe following tables include a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets\nas well as a summary of the related amounts recognized in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31 of the respective\nyears. 3M also has certain non-qualified unfunded pension and postretirement benefit plans, inclusive of plans related to supplement/excess\nbenefits for employees impacted by particular relocations and other matters, that individually and in the aggregate are not significant and\nwhich are not included in the tables that follow. The obligations for these plans are included within other liabilities in the Company’s\nconsolidated balance sheet and aggregated less than $35 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.\n \n \n \nQualified and Non-qualified\n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nPension Benefits\n \nPostretirement\n \n \n \nUnited States\n \nInternational\n \nBenefits\n \n(Millions)\n    \n2015\n    \n2014\n    \n2015\n    \n2014\n    \n2015\n    \n2014\n \nChange in benefit obligation\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nBenefit obligation at beginning of year\n $\n16,452  $\n13,967  $\n6,979  $\n6,346  $\n2,462  $\n2,017  \nAcquisitions/Transfers in\n  \n —   \n —   \n94   \n —   \n —   \n —  \nService cost\n  \n293   \n241   \n154   \n141   \n75   \n65  \nInterest cost\n  \n655   \n676   \n206   \n252   \n98   \n97  \nParticipant contributions\n  \n —   \n —   \n9   \n10   \n14   \n18  \nForeign exchange rate changes\n  \n —   \n —   \n(589)  \n(663)  \n(22)  \n(11) \nPlan amendments\n  \n —   \n(266)  \n(6)  \n3   \n(211)  \n —  \nActuarial (gain) loss\n  \n(657)  \n2,874   \n(274)  \n1,128   \n(80)  \n415  \nMedicare Part D Reimbursement\n  \n —   \n —   \n —   \n —   \n1   \n1  \nBenefit payments\n  \n(874)  \n(1,039)  \n(232)  \n(235)  \n(122)  \n(140) \nSettlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and\nother\n  \n(13)  \n(1)  \n(19)  \n(3)  \n1   \n —  \nBenefit obligation at end of year\n $\n15,856  $\n16,452  $\n6,322  $\n6,979  $\n2,216  $\n2,462  \nChange in plan assets\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nFair value of plan assets at beginning of year\n $\n14,643  $\n13,889  $\n5,957  $\n5,758  $\n1,436  $\n1,405  \nAcquisitions/Transfers in\n  \n —   \n —   \n8   \n —   \n —   \n —  \nActual return on plan assets\n  \n100   \n1,749   \n287   \n813   \n36   \n148  \nCompany contributions\n  \n113   \n45   \n151   \n165   \n3   \n5  \nParticipant contributions\n  \n —   \n —   \n9   \n10   \n14   \n18  \nForeign exchange rate changes\n  \n —   \n —   \n(498)  \n(554)  \n —   \n —  \nBenefit payments\n  \n(874)  \n(1,039)  \n(232)  \n(235)  \n(122)  \n(140) \nSettlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and\nother\n  \n(16)  \n(1)  \n(13)  \n —   \n —   \n —  \nFair value of plan assets at end of year\n $\n13,966  $\n14,643  $\n5,669  $\n5,957  $\n1,367  $\n1,436  \nFunded status at end of year\n $\n(1,890) $\n(1,809) $\n(653) $\n(1,022) $\n(849) $\n(1,026) \n \n83\n \nTable of Contents \n \n \nQualified and Non-qualified\n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nPension Benefits\n \nPostretirement\n \n \n \nUnited States\n \nInternational\n \nBenefits\n \n(Millions)\n    \n2015\n    \n2014\n    \n2015\n    \n2014\n    \n2015\n    \n2014\n \nAmounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as\nof Dec. 31,\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nNon-current assets\n $\n3  $\n3  $\n185  $\n43  $\n —  $\n —  \nAccrued benefit cost\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nCurrent liabilities\n  \n(47)  \n(46)  \n(10)  \n(10)  \n(3)  \n(4) \nNon-current liabilities\n  \n(1,846)  \n(1,766)  \n(828)  \n(1,055)  \n(846)  \n(1,022) \nEnding balance\n $\n(1,890) $\n(1,809) $\n(653) $\n(1,022) $\n(849) $\n(1,026) \n \n \n \nQualified and Non-qualified\n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nPension Benefits\n \nPostretirement\n \n \n \nUnited States\n \nInternational\n \nBenefits\n \n(Millions)\n    \n2015\n    \n2014\n    \n2015\n    \n2014\n    \n2015\n    \n2014\n \nAmounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive\nincome as of Dec. 31,\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nNet transition obligation (asset)\n $\n —  $\n —  $\n(2) $\n(3) $\n —  $\n —  \nNet actuarial loss (gain)\n  \n5,366   \n5,462   \n1,610   \n2,200   \n815   \n914  \nPrior service cost (credit)\n  \n(227)  \n(251)  \n(68)  \n(93)  \n(270)  \n(102) \nEnding balance\n $\n5,139  $\n5,211  $\n1,540  $\n2,104  $\n545  $\n812  \n \nThe balance of amounts recognized for international p\n\n--------------------------------\nAnd here is your task:\n\nExtract the exact figure (in millions) for \'Total Revenue\' or \'Net Sales\' for the year 2014.

transitioning all current and future retirees in the U.S. postretirement health care benefit plans to a savings\naccount benefits-based plan. The contributions provided by the Company to the health savings accounts increase 3 percent per year for\nemployees who retired prior to January 1, 2016 and increase 1.5 percent for employees who retire on or after January 1, 2016. Therefore,\nthe Company no longer has material exposure to health care cost inflation.\n \nThe Company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the December 31 measurement date for the pension and\npostretirement benefit plans, which is also the date used for the related annual measurement assumptions. The discount rate reflects the\ncurrent rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. The Company sets its rate to reflect the\nyield of a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle\nprojected future benefits. Using this methodology, the Company determined a discount rate of 4.47% for pension and 4.48% for\npostretirement benefits to be appropriate for its U.S. plans as of December 31, 2015, which is an increase of 0.37 percentage points and 0.41\npercentage points, respectively, from the rates used as of December 31, 2014. For the international pension and postretirement plans the\ndiscount rates also reflect the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. If the country\nhas a deep market in corporate bonds the Company matches the expected cash flows from the plan either to a portfolio of bonds that\ngenerate sufficient cash flow or a notional yield curve generated from available bond information. In countries that do not have a deep\nmarket in corporate bonds, government bonds are considered with a risk premium to approximate corporate bond yields. Beginning in 2016,\n3M changed the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic pension and other postretirement\nbenefit costs. The new method measures service and interest costs separately using the spot yield curve approach applied to each\ncorresponding obligation. Service costs are determined based on duration-specific spot rates applied to the service cost cash flows. The\ninterest cost calculation is determined by applying duration-specific spot rates to the year-by-year projected benefit payments. The spot yield\ncurve approach does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest costs offset in the\nactuarial gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income. The Company changed to the new method to provide a more precise\nmeasure of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between the projected benefit cash flows and the discrete spot yield curve\nrates. The Company accounted for this change as a change in estimate prospectively beginning in the first quarter of 2016.\n \nFor the primary U.S. qualified pension plan, the Company’s assumption for the expected return on plan assets was 7.75% in 2015. Projected\nreturns are based primarily on broad, publicly traded equity and fixed-income indices and forward-looking estimates of active portfolio and\ninvestment management. As of December 31, 2015, the Company’s 2016 expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets is 7.50%, a\ndecrease of 0.25 percentage points from 2015. The expected return assumption is based on the strategic asset allocation of the plan, long\nterm capital market return expectations and expected performance from active investment management.

In 2014 the plan earned a rate of return of 13.0% and in 2013 earned a return\nof 6.0%. The average annual actual return on the plan assets over the past 10 and 25 years has been 7.8% and 10.0%, respectively. Return on\nassets assumptions for international pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are calculated on a plan-by-plan basis using plan asset\nallocations and expected long-term rate of return assumptions.\n \nDuring 2015, the Company contributed $264 million to its U.S. and international pension plans and $3 million to its postretirement plans.\nDuring 2014, the Company contributed $210 million to its U.S. and international pension plans and $5 million to its postretirement plans. In\n2016, the Company expects to contribute an amount in the range of $100 million to $200 million of cash to its U.S. and international\nretirement plans.

The primary goal of the\ntrust funds is to meet the obligations as required. The secondary goal is to earn the highest rate of return possible, without jeopardizing its\nprimary goal, and without subjecting the Company to an undue amount of contribution risk. Fund returns are used to help finance present\nand future obligations to the extent possible within actuarially determined funding limits and tax-determined asset limits, thus reducing the\npotential need for additional contributions from 3M. The investment strategy has used long duration cash bonds and derivative instruments\nto offset a significant portion of the interest rate sensitivity of U.S. pension liabilities.\n \nNormally, 3M does not buy or sell any of its own securities as a direct investment for its pension and other postretirement benefit funds.\nHowever, due to external investment management of the funds, the plans may indirectly buy, sell or hold 3M securities. The aggregate\namount of 3M securities are not considered to be material relative to the aggregate fund percentages.\n \nThe discussion that follows references the fair value measurements of certain assets in terms of levels 1, 2 and 3. See Note 13 for\ndescriptions of these levels. While the company believes the valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market\nparticipants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a\ndifferent estimate of fair value at the reporting date.\n \n87\n \nTable of Contents \nU.S. Pension Plans and Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets\n \nIn order to achieve the investment objectives in the U.S. pension plans and U.S. postretirement benefit plans, the investment policies include\na target strategic asset allocation. The investment policies allow some tolerance around the target in recognition that market fluctuations and\nilliquidity of some investments may cause the allocation to a specific asset class to vary from the target allocation, potentially for long\nperiods of time. Acceptable ranges have been designed to allow for deviation from strategic targets and to allow for the opportunity for\ntactical over- and under-weights. The portfolios will normally be rebalanced when the quarter-end asset allocation deviates from acceptable\nranges. The allocation is reviewed regularly by the named fiduciary of the plans.  Approximately 39% of the postretirement benefit plan\nassets are in a 401(h) account.

Beginning in the second quarter of 2014, 3M began\nextending the maximum length of time over which it hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows of the forecasted transactions\nfrom a previous term of 12 months to a longer term of 24 months, with certain currencies being extended further to 36 months starting in the\nfirst quarter of 2015.\n \nCash Flow Hedging - Commodity Price Management: The Company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts,\nprice protection agreements and forward contracts. 3M discontinued the use of commodity price swaps as cash flow hedges of forecasted\ncommodity transactions in the first quarter of 2015. The Company used commodity price swaps as cash flow hedges of forecasted\ncommodity transactions to manage price volatility. The related mark-to-market gain or loss on qualifying hedges was included in other\ncomprehensive income to the extent effective, and reclassified into cost of sales in the period during which the hedged transaction affected\nearnings.\n \nCash Flow Hedging — Interest Rate Contracts: In the third and fourth quarters of 2014, the Company entered into forward starting interest\nrate swaps with notional amounts totaling 500 million Euros as a hedge against interest rate volatility associated with the forecasted issuance\nof fixed rate debt. 3M terminated these interest rate swaps upon issuance of 750 million Euros aggregate principal amount of twelve-year\nfixed rate notes in connection with 3M’s 1.250 billion Eurobond offering in November 2014. The termination resulted in a $8 million pre-\ntax ($5 million after-tax) loss within accumulated other comprehensive income that will be amortized over the twelve-year life of the notes.\n \nThe amortization of gains and losses on forward starting interest rate swaps is included in the tables below as part of the gain/(loss)\nrecognized in income on the effective portion of derivatives as a result of reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income.\n \nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company had a balance of $124 million associated with the after tax net unrealized gain associated with cash\nflow hedging instruments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. This includes a remaining balance of $5 million (after tax\nloss) related to forward starting interest rate swaps, which will be amortized over the respective lives of the notes. Based on exchange rates\nas of December 31, 2015, 3M expects to reclassify approximately $98 million of the after-tax net unrealized foreign exchange cash flow\nhedging gains to earnings in 2016, approximately $23 million of the after-tax net unrealized foreign exchange cash flow hedging gains to\nearnings in 2017, and approximately $3 million of the after-tax net unrealized foreign exchange cash flow hedging gains to earnings after\n2017 (with the impact offset by earnings/losses from underlying hedged items).\n \nThe location in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and amounts of gains and losses related to derivative\ninstruments designated as cash flow hedges are provided in the following table. Reclassifications of amounts from accumulated other\ncomprehensive income into income include accumulated gains (losses) on dedesignated hedges at the time earnings are impacted by the\nforecasted transaction.\n92\n \nTable of Contents \nYear Ended December 31, 2015\n \n \n \n \n \nPretax Gain (Loss) Recognized in\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nPretax Gain (Loss)\n \nIncome on Effective Portion of\n \nIneffective Portion of Gain\n \n \n \nRecognized in Other\n \nDerivative as a Result of\n \n(Loss) on Derivative and\n \n \n \nComprehensive\n \nReclassification from\n \nAmount Excluded from\n \n \n \nIncome on Effective\n \nAccumulated Other\n \nEffectiveness Testing\n \n(Millions)\n \nPortion of Derivative\n \nComprehensive Income\n \nRecognized in Income\n \nDerivatives in Cash Flow Hedging Relationships\n    \nAmount\n    \nLocation\n    \nAmount\n    \nLocation\n    \nAmount\n \nForeign currency forward/option contracts\n $\n212  \nCost of sales\n \n$\n178  \nCost of sales\n $\n—  \nCommodity price swap contracts\n \n \n —  \nCost of sales\n \n \n(2) \nCost of sales\n \n \n—  \nInterest rate swap contracts\n \n \n—  \nInterest expense\n \n \n(2) \nInterest expense\n \n \n—  \nTotal\n $\n212  \n  \n$\n174  \n  $\n —  \n \nYear Ended December 31, 2014\n \n \n \n \n \nPretax Gain (Loss) Recognized in\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nPretax Gain (Loss)\n \nIncome on Effective Portion of\n \nIneffective Portion of Gain\n \n \n \nRecognized in Other\n \nDerivative as a Result of\n \n(Loss) on Derivative and\n \n \n \nComprehensive\n \nReclassification from\n \nAmount Excluded from\n \n \n \nIncome on Effective\n \nAccumulated Other\n \nEffectiveness Testing\n \n(Millions)\n \nPortion of Derivative\n \nComprehensive Income\n \nRecognized in Income\n \nDerivatives in Cash Flow Hedging Relationships\n    \nAmount\n    \nLocation\n    \nAmount\n    \nLocation\n    \nAmount\n \nForeign currency forward/option contracts\n $\n183  \nCost of sales\n \n$\n3  \nCost of sales\n $\n—  \nCommodity price swap contracts\n \n \n(4) \nCost of sales\n \n \n2  \nCost of sales\n \n \n—  \nInterest rate swap contracts\n \n \n(8) \nInterest expense\n \n \n(1) \nInterest expense\n \n \n—  \nTotal\n $\n171   \n \n$\n4   \n $\n —  \n \nYear Ended December 31, 2013\n \n  \n \n \nPretax Gain (Loss) Recognized in\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nPretax Gain (Loss)\n \nIncome on Effective Portion of\n \nIneffective Portion of Gain\n \n \n \nRecognized in Other\n \nDerivative as a Result of\n \n(Loss) on Derivative and\n \n \n \nComprehensive\n \nReclassification from\n \nAmount Excluded from\n \n \n \nIncome on Effective\n \nAccumulated Other\n \nEffectiveness Testing\n \n(Millions)\n \nPortion of Derivative\n \nComprehensive Income\n \nRecognized in Income\n \nDerivatives in Cash Flow Hedging Relationships\n    \nAmount\n    \nLocation\n    \nAmount\n    \nLocation\n    \nAmount\n \nForeign currency forward/option contracts\n $\n9  \nCost of sales\n \n$\n(11) \nCost of sales\n $\n—  \nForeign currency forward contracts\n \n \n(108) \nInterest expense\n \n \n(108) \nInterest expense\n \n \n—  \nCommodity price swap contracts\n \n \n1  \nCost of sales\n \n \n(2) \nCost of sales\n \n \n—  \nInterest rate swap contracts\n \n \n —  \nInterest expense\n \n \n(1) \nInterest expense\n \n \n—  \nTotal\n $\n(98)  \n \n$\n(122)  \n $\n —  \n \nFair Value Hedges:\n \nFor derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivatives as well as the offsetting\nloss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current earnings.\n \nFair Value Hedging - Interest Rate Swaps: The Company manages interest expense using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. To help\nmanage borrowing costs, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps. Under these arrangements, the Company agrees to exchange, at\nspecified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal\namount. The mark-to-market of these fair value hedges is recorded as gains or losses in interest expense and is offset by the gain or loss of\nthe underlying debt instrument, which also is recorded in interest expense. These fair value hedges are highly effective and, thus, there is no\nimpact on earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness.\n \nIn July 2007, in connection with the issuance of a seven-year Eurobond for an amount of 750 million Euros, the Company completed a\nfixed-to-floating interest rate swap on a notional amount of 400 million Euros as a fair value hedge of a portion of the fixed interest rate\nEurobond obligation. In August 2010, the Company terminated 150 million Euros of the notional amount of this swap. As a result, a gain of\n18 million Euros, recorded as part of the balance of the underlying debt, was amortized as an offset to interest expense over this debt’s\nremaining life.

The remaining interest rate swap of 250 million Euros (notional amount) matured in\nJuly 2014.\n \n93\n \nTable of Contents \nIn November 2013, 3M issued a Eurobond due in 2021 for a face amount of 600 million Euros. Upon debt issuance, 3M completed a fixed-\nto-floating interest rate swap on a notional amount of 300 million Euros as a fair value hedge of a portion of the fixed interest rate Eurobond\nobligation.\n \nIn June 2014, 3M issued $950 million aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes. Upon debt issuance, the Company entered into an\ninterest rate swap to convert $600 million of a $625 million note included in this issuance to an interest rate based on a floating three-month\nLIBOR index as a fair value hedge of a portion of the fixed interest rate medium-term note obligation.\n \nIn August 2015, 3M issued $1.500 billion aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes. Upon debt issuance, the Company entered into\ntwo interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of a portion of the fixed interest rate medium-term note obligation.

For instruments that are\ndesignated and qualify as hedges of net investments in foreign operations and that meet the effectiveness requirements, the net gains or\nlosses attributable to changes in spot exchange rates are recorded in cumulative translation within other comprehensive income. The\nremainder of the change in value of such instruments is recorded in earnings. Recognition in earnings of amounts previously recorded in\ncumulative translation is limited to circumstances such as complete or substantially complete liquidation of the net investment in the hedged\nforeign operation. To the extent foreign currency denominated debt is not designated in or is dedesignated from a net investment hedge\nrelationship, changes in value of that portion of foreign currency denominated debt due to exchange rate changes are recorded in earnings\nthrough their maturity date.\n \n3M’s use of foreign exchange forward contracts designated in hedges of the Company’s net investment in foreign subsidiaries can vary by\ntime period depending on when foreign currency denominated debt balances designated in such relationships are dedesignated, matured, or\nare newly issued and designated. Additionally, variation can occur in connection with the extent of the Company’s desired foreign exchange\nrisk coverage.\n \nAt December 31, 2015, the total notional amount of foreign exchange forward contracts designated in net investment hedges was\napproximately 974 million Euros and approximately 248 billion South Korean Won, along with a principal\n94\n \nTable of Contents \namount of long-term debt instruments designated in net investment hedges totaling 3.6 billion Euros.

However, the Company’s risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments. The Company\nactively monitors its exposure to credit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit limits, and by selecting major international banks\nand financial institutions as counterparties. 3M enters into master netting arrangements with counterparties when possible to mitigate credit\nrisk in derivative transactions. A master netting arrangement may allow each counterparty to net settle amounts owed between a 3M entity\nand the counterparty as a result of multiple, separate derivative transactions. As of December 31, 2015, 3M has International Swaps and\nDerivatives Association (ISDA) agreements with 16 applicable banks and financial institutions which contain netting provisions. In\naddition to a master agreement with 3M supported by a primary counterparty’s parent guarantee, 3M also has associated credit support\nagreements in place with 15 of its primary derivative counterparties which, among other things, provide the circumstances under which\neither party is required to post eligible collateral (when the market value of transactions covered by these agreements exceeds specified\nthresholds or if a counterparty’s credit rating has been downgraded to a predetermined rating). The Company does not anticipate\nnonperformance by any of these counterparties.\n \n3M has elected to present the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities within the Company’s consolidated balance sheet on a gross basis\neven when derivative transactions are subject to master netting arrangements and may otherwise qualify for net presentation. However, the\nfollowing tables provide information as if the Company had elected to offset the asset and liability balances of derivative instruments, netted\nin accordance with various criteria in the event of default or termination as stipulated by the terms of netting arrangements with each of the\ncounterparties.

Fair Value Measurements\n \n3M follows ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, with respect to assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a\nrecurring basis and nonrecurring basis. Under the standard, fair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount that would be received to\nsell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. The standard\nalso establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of\nunobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs market participants\nwould use in valuing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company.\nUnobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions about the factors market participants would use in valuing the asset\nor liability developed based upon the best information available in the circumstances. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels. Level\n1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar\nassets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs (other\nthan quoted prices) that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the\nasset or liability. Categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value\nmeasurement.\n \nAssets and Liabilities that are Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis:\n \nFor 3M, assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis primarily relate to available-for-sale marketable securities,\navailable-for-sale investments (included as part of investments in the Consolidated Balance Sheet) and certain derivative instruments.\nDerivatives include cash flow hedges, interest rate swaps and most net investment hedges.

Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the respective financial assets and liabilities measured at\nfair value.\n \nAvailable-for-sale marketable securities — except certain U.S. municipal securities:\n \nMarketable securities, except certain U.S. municipal securities, are valued utilizing multiple sources. A weighted average price is used for\nthese securities. Market prices are obtained for these securities from a variety of industry standard data providers, security master files from\nlarge financial institutions, and other third-party sources. These multiple prices are used as inputs into a distribution-curve-based algorithm\nto determine the daily fair value to be used. 3M classifies U.S. treasury securities as level 1, while all other marketable securities (excluding\ncertain U.S. municipal securities) are classified as level 2. Marketable securities are discussed further in Note 9.\n \nAvailable-for-sale marketable securities —certain U.S. municipal securities only:\n \nIn the fourth quarter 2014, 3M obtained a municipal bond with the City of Nevada, Missouri, which represent 3M’s only U.S. municipal\nsecurities holding as of December 31, 2015. Due to the nature of this security, the valuation method utilized will include the financial health\nof the City of Nevada, any recent municipal bond issuances by Nevada, and macroeconomic considerations related to the direction of\ninterest rates and the health of the overall municipal bond market, and as such will be classified as a level 3 security.\n \nAvailable-for-sale investments:\n \nInvestments include equity securities that are traded in an active market. Closing stock prices are readily available from active markets and\nare used as being representative of fair value. 3M classifies these securities as level 1.\n \nDerivative instruments:\n \nThe Company’s derivative assets and liabilities within the scope of ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, are required to be recorded at fair\nvalue. The Company’s derivatives that are recorded at fair value include foreign currency forward and option contracts, commodity price\nswaps, interest rate swaps, and net investment hedges where the hedging instrument is recorded at fair value. Net investment hedges that use\nforeign currency denominated debt to hedge 3M’s net investment are not impacted by the fair value measurement standard under ASC 820,\nas the debt used as the hedging instrument is marked to a value with respect to changes in spot foreign currency exchange rates and not with\nrespect to other factors that may impact fair value.\n \n3M has determined that foreign currency forwards, commodity price swaps, currency swaps, foreign currency options, interest rate swaps\nand cross-currency swaps will be considered level 2 measurements. 3M uses inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the\nasset. These inputs include foreign currency exchange rates, volatilities, and interest rates. Derivative positions are primarily valued using\nstandard calculations/models that use as their basis readily observable market parameters. Industry standard data providers are 3M’s primary\nsource for forward and spot rate information for both interest rates and currency rates, with resulting valuations periodically validated\nthrough third-party or counterparty quotes and a net present value stream of cash flows model.\n \n99\n \nTable of Contents \nThe following tables provide information by level for assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis.\n \n  \n \n \nFair Value Measurements\n \n(Millions)\n \nFair Value at\n \nUsing Inputs Considered as\n \nDescription\n    December 31, 2015     \nLevel 1\n    \nLevel 2\n    \nLevel 3\n \nAssets:\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nAvailable-for-sale:\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nMarketable securities:\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nForeign government agency securities\n $\n10  $\n —  $\n10  $\n —  \nCorporate debt securities\n \n \n10   \n —   \n10   \n —  \nCommercial paper\n \n \n12  \n \n —  \n \n12  \n \n —  \nCertificates of deposit/time deposits\n \n \n26   \n —   \n26   \n —  \nAsset-backed securities:\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nAutomobile loan related\n \n \n26   \n —   \n26   \n —  \nCredit card related\n \n \n10   \n —   \n10   \n —  \nEquipment lease related\n \n \n2   \n —   \n2   \n —  \nOther\n \n \n19   \n —   \n19   \n —  \nU.S. municipal securities\n \n \n12   \n —   \n —   \n12  \nDerivative instruments — assets:\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nForeign currency forward/option contracts\n \n \n272   \n —   \n272   \n —  \nInterest rate swap contracts\n \n \n24   \n —   \n24   \n —  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nLiabilities:\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nDerivative instruments — liabilities:\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nForeign currency forward/option contracts\n \n \n68   \n —   \n68   \n —  \nInterest rate swap contracts\n \n \n1   \n —   \n1   \n —  \n \n \n  \n \n \nFair Value Measurements\n \n(Millions)\n \nFair Value at\n \nUsing Inputs Considered as\n \nDescription\n    December 31, 2014     \nLevel 1\n    \nLevel 2\n    \nLevel 3\n \nAssets:\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nAvailable-for-sale:\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nMarketable securities:\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nU.S. government agency securities\n $\n108  $\n —  $\n108  $\n —  \nForeign government agency securities\n \n \n95   \n —   \n95   \n —  \nCorporate debt securities\n \n \n619   \n —   \n619   \n —  \nCertificates of deposit/time deposits\n \n \n41   \n —   \n41   \n —  \nAsset-backed securities:\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nAutomobile loan related\n \n \n282   \n —   \n282   \n —  \nCredit card related\n \n \n162   \n —   \n162   \n —  \nEquipment lease related\n \n \n48   \n —   \n48   \n —  \nOther\n \n \n46   \n —   \n46   \n —  \nU.S. treasury securities\n \n \n38   \n38   \n —   \n —  \nU.S. municipal securities\n \n \n15   \n —   \n —   \n15  \nInvestments\n \n \n1   \n1   \n —   \n —  \nDerivative instruments — assets:\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nForeign currency forward/option contracts\n \n \n229   \n —   \n229   \n —  \nInterest rate swap contracts\n \n \n27   \n —   \n27   \n —  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nLiabilities:\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nDerivative instruments — liabilities:\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nForeign currency forward/option contracts\n \n \n36   \n —   \n36   \n —  \nCommodity price swap contracts\n \n \n4  \n \n —  \n \n4  \n \n —  \nInterest rate swap contracts\n \n \n3   \n —   \n3   \n —  \n \n100\n \nTable of Contents \nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of items measured at fair value on a recurring basis in\nthe table above that used significant unobservable inputs (level 3).\n \n(Millions)\n     \n \n     \n \n     \n \n \nMarketable securities — certain U.S. municipal securities and auction rate\n     \n \n     \n \n     \n \n \nsecurities only\n \n2015\n \n2014\n \n2013\n \nBeginning balance\n $\n15  $\n11  $\n7  \nTotal gains or losses:\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nIncluded in earnings\n \n \n —  \n \n(1) \n \n—  \nIncluded in other comprehensive income\n \n \n —  \n \n2  \n \n4  \nPurchases and issuances\n \n \n —  \n \n15  \n \n—  \nSales and settlements\n \n \n(3) \n \n(12) \n \n—  \nTransfers in and/or out of level 3\n \n \n—  \n \n—  \n \n—  \nEnding balance\n \n \n12  \n \n15  \n \n11  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nChange in unrealized gains or losses for the period included in earnings for\nsecurities held at the end of the reporting period\n \n \n—  \n \n—  \n \n—  \n \nIn addition, the plan assets of 3M’s pension and postretirement benefit plans are measured at fair value on a recurring basis (at least\nannually).

For 3M, such measurements of fair value relate primarily to long-lived asset\nimpairments. There were no material long-lived asset impairments for 2015, 2014 and 2013.\n \nFair Value of Financial Instruments:\n \nThe Company’s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, certain investments,\naccounts payable, borrowings, and derivative contracts. The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable,\nand short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt (except the medium-term fixed rate notes totaling $1 billion, which will\nmature in September 2016 and are shown separately in the table below) approximated carrying values because of the short-term nature of\nthese instruments. Available-for-sale marketable securities and investments, in addition to certain derivative instruments, are recorded at fair\nvalues as indicated in the preceding disclosures. For its long-term debt, the Company utilized third-party quotes to estimate fair values\n(classified as level 2).

Commitments and Contingencies \n \nCapital and Operating Leases:\n \nRental expense under operating leases was $316 million in 2015, $332 million in 2014 and $330 million in 2013. It is 3M’s practice to\nsecure renewal rights for leases, thereby giving 3M the right, but not the obligation, to maintain a presence in a leased facility. 3M has three\nprimary capital leases. First, 3M has a capital lease, which became effective in April 2003, that involves a building in the United Kingdom\n(with a lease term of 22 years). During the second quarter of 2003, 3M recorded a capital lease asset and obligation of approximately 33.5\nmillion British Pound (GBP), or approximately $50 million at December 31, 2015, exchange rates. Second, during the fourth quarter of\n2009, 3M recorded a capital lease asset and obligation of approximately $50 million related to an IT investment with an amortization period\nof seven years. Third, in the fourth quarter of 2014, 3M recorded a capital lease asset and obligation of approximately $15 million, which is\ndiscussed in more detail in Note 7.\n \nMinimum lease payments under capital and operating leases with non-cancelable terms in excess of one year as of December 31, 2015, were\nas follows:\n \n \n        \n \n    \nOperating\n \n(Millions)\n \nCapital Leases\n \nLeases\n \n2016\n $\n11  $\n234  \n2017\n \n \n6  \n \n191  \n2018\n \n \n4  \n \n134  \n2019\n \n \n3  \n \n86  \n2020\n \n \n3  \n \n72  \nAfter 2020\n \n \n32  \n \n226  \nTotal\n $\n59  $\n943  \nLess: Amounts representing interest\n \n \n5  \n \n  \nPresent value of future minimum lease payments\n \n \n54  \n \n  \nLess: Current obligations under capital leases\n \n \n8  \n \n  \nLong-term obligations under capital leases\n $\n46  \n \n  \n \nUnconditional Purchase Obligations:\n \nUnconditional purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding (non-\ncancelable, or cancelable only in certain circumstances). The Company estimates its total unconditional purchase obligation commitment\n(for those contracts with terms in excess of one year) as of December 31, 2015, at $596 million. Payments by year are estimated as follows:\n2016 ($193 million), 2017 ($160 million), 2018 ($102 million), 2019 ($54 million), 2020 ($56 million) and after 2020 ($31 million). Many\nof these commitments relate to take or pay contracts, in which 3M guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or services that are\nsold to customers. The Company expects to receive consideration (products or services) for these unconditional purchase obligations. The\npurchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items for which the\nCompany is contractually obligated. The majority of 3M’s products and services are purchased as needed, with no unconditional\ncommitment. For this reason, these amounts will not provide an indication of the Company’s expected future cash outflows related to\npurchase obligations.\n \nWarranties/Guarantees:\n \n3M’s accrued product warranty liabilities, recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as part of current and long-term liabilities, are\nestimated at approximately $28 million at December 31, 2015, and $30 million at December 31, 2014. 3M does not consider this amount to\nbe material. The fair value of 3M guarantees of loans with third parties and other guarantee arrangements are not material.\n \n102\n \nTable of Contents \nRelated Party Activity:\n \n3M does not have any material related party activity.\n \nLegal Proceedings:\n \nThe Company and some of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous claims and lawsuits, principally in the United States, and regulatory\nproceedings worldwide. These include various products liability (involving products that the Company now or formerly manufactured and\nsold), intellectual property, and commercial claims and lawsuits, including those brought under the antitrust laws, and environmental\nproceedings. Unless otherwise stated, the Company is vigorously defending all such litigation.\n \nProcess for Disclosure and Recording of Liabilities and Insurance Receivables Related to Legal Proceedings\n \nMany lawsuits and claims involve highly complex issues relating to causation, scientific evidence, and whether there are actual damages and\nare otherwise subject to substantial uncertainties. Assessments of lawsuits and claims can involve a series of complex judgments about\nfuture events and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. The Company complies with the requirements of ASC 450, Contingencies,\nand related guidance, and records liabilities for legal proceedings in those instances where it can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss\nand where liability is probable. Where the reasonable estimate of the probable loss is a range, the Company records the most likely estimate\nof the loss, or the low end of the range if there is no one best estimate. The Company either discloses the amount of a possible loss or range\nof loss in excess of established accruals if estimable, or states that such an estimate cannot be made. The Company discloses significant\nlegal proceedings even where liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable, or both, if the Company believes there\nis at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred.\n \nThe Company estimates insurance receivables based on an analysis of its numerous policies, including their exclusions, pertinent case law\ninterpreting comparable policies, its experience with similar claims, and assessment of the nature of the claim and remaining coverage, and\nrecords an amount it has concluded is likely to be recovered. For those insured matters where the Company has taken an accrual, the\nCompany also records receivables for the amount of insurance that it expects to recover under the Company’s insurance program. For those\ninsured matters where the Company has not taken an accrual because the liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not\nestimable, or both, but where the Company has incurred an expense in defending itself, the Company records receivables for the amount of\ninsurance that it expects to recover for the expense incurred.\n \nBecause litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings or developments could occur, there can be no certainty that\nthe Company may not ultimately incur charges in excess of presently recorded liabilities. A future adverse ruling, settlement, or unfavorable\ndevelopment could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations or cash flows in\nthe period in which they are recorded. Although the Company cannot estimate its exposure to all legal proceedings, it currently believes that\nsuch future charges, if any, would not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of the Company. Based on\nexperience and developments, the Company reexamines its estimates of probable liabilities and associated expenses and receivables each\nperiod, and whether it is able to estimate a liability previously determined to be not estimable and/or not probable. Where appropriate, the\nCompany makes additions to or adjustments of its estimated liabilities. As a result, the current estimates of the potential impact on the\nCompany’s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the legal proceedings and claims pending against the\nCompany could change in the future.\n \nThe following sections first describe the significant legal proceedings in which the Company is involved, and then describe the liabilities\nand associated insurance receivables the Company has accrued relating to its significant legal proceedings.\n \n103\n \nTable of Contents \nRespirator Mask/Asbestos Litigation\n \nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company is a named defendant, with multiple co-defendants, in numerous lawsuits in various courts that\npurport to represent approximately 2,130 individual claimants, compared to approximately 2,220 individual claimants with actions pending\nat December 31, 2014.\n \nThe vast majority of the lawsuits and claims resolved by and currently pending against the Company allege use of some of the Company’s\nmask and respirator products and seek damages from the Company and other defendants for alleged personal injury from workplace\nexposures to asbestos, silica, coal mine dust or other occupational dusts found in products manufactured by other defendants or generally in\nthe workplace. A minority of the lawsuits and claims resolved by and currently pending against the Company generally allege personal\ninjury from occupational exposure to asbestos from products previously manufactured by the Company, which are often unspecified, as\nwell as products manufactured by other defendants, or occasionally at Company premises.\n \nThe Company’s current volume of new and pending matters is substantially lower than it experienced at the peak of filings in 2003. The\nCompany expects that filing of claims by unimpaired claimants in the future will continue to be at much lower levels than in the past.\nAccordingly, the number of claims alleging more serious injuries, including mesothelioma and other malignancies, will represent a greater\npercentage of total claims than in the past. The Company has prevailed in all ten cases taken to trial, including eight of the nine cases tried to\nverdict (such trials occurred in 1999, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2004, 2007, and 2015), and an appellate reversal in 2005 of the 2001 jury verdict\nadverse to the Company. The remaining case, tried in 2009, was dismissed by the court at the close of plaintiff’s evidence, based on the\ncourt’s legal finding that the plaintiff had not presented sufficient evidence to support a jury verdict.\n \nThe Company has demonstrated in these past trial proceedings\n\n--------------------------------\nAnd here is your task:\n\nExtract the exact figure (in millions) for \'Total Revenue\' or \'Net Sales\' for the year 2014.

Consequently the Company believes that claimants are unable to establish that their\nmedical conditions, even if significant, are attributable to the Company’s respiratory protection products. Nonetheless the Company’s\nlitigation experience indicates that claims of persons with malignant conditions are costlier to resolve than the claims of unimpaired persons,\nand it therefore believes the average cost of resolving pending and future claims on a per-claim basis will continue to be higher than it\nexperienced in prior periods when the vast majority of claims were asserted by the unimpaired.\n \nAs previously reported, the State of West Virginia, through its Attorney General, filed a complaint in 2003 against the Company and two\nother manufacturers of respiratory protection products in the Circuit Court of Lincoln County, West Virginia, and amended its complaint in\n2005. The amended complaint seeks substantial, but unspecified, compensatory damages primarily for reimbursement of the costs allegedly\nincurred by the State for worker’s compensation and healthcare benefits provided to all workers with occupational pneumoconiosis and\nunspecified punitive damages. The case has been inactive since the fourth quarter of 2007, other than a case management conference in\nMarch 2011. In November 2013, the State filed a motion to bifurcate the lawsuit into separate liability and damages proceedings. At the\nhearing on the motion, the court declined to bifurcate the lawsuit. No liability has been recorded for this matter because the Company\nbelieves that liability is not probable and estimable at this time. In addition, the Company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of\nloss given the lack of any meaningful discovery responses by the State of West Virginia, the otherwise minimal activity in this case and the\nfact that the complaint asserts claims against two other manufacturers where a defendant’s share of liability may turn on the law of joint and\nseveral liability and by the amount of fault, if any, a jury might allocate to each defendant if the case is ultimately tried.\n \nRespirator Mask/Asbestos Liabilities and Insurance Receivables: The Company estimates its respirator mask/asbestos liabilities, including\nthe cost to resolve the claims and defense costs, by examining: (i) the Company’s experience in resolving claims, (ii) apparent trends,\n(iii) the apparent quality of claims (e.g., whether the claim has been asserted on behalf of asymptomatic claimants), (iv) changes in the\nnature and mix of claims (e.g., the proportion of claims asserting usage of the Company’s mask or respirator products and alleging exposure\nto each of asbestos, silica, coal or other occupational dusts, and claims pleading use of asbestos-containing products allegedly manufactured\nby the Company), (v) the number of current claims and a projection of the number of future asbestos and other claims that may be filed\nagainst the Company, (vi) the cost to resolve recently settled claims, and (vii) an estimate of the cost to resolve and defend against current\nand future claims.\n104\n \nTable of Contents \n \nDevelopments may occur that could affect the Company’s estimate of its liabilities. These developments include, but are not limited to,\nsignificant changes in (i) the number of future claims, (ii) the average cost of resolving claims, (iii) the legal costs of defending these claims\nand in maintaining trial readiness, (iv) changes in the mix and nature of claims received, (v) trial and appellate outcomes, (vi) changes in the\nlaw and procedure applicable to these claims, and (vii) the financial viability of other co-defendants and insurers.\n \nAs a result of the Company’s cost of resolving claims of persons who claim more serious injuries, including mesothelioma and other\nmalignancies, the Company increased its accruals in 2015 for respirator mask/asbestos liabilities by $50 million. In 2015, the Company\nmade payments for legal fees and settlements of $46 million related to the respirator mask/asbestos litigation. As of December 31, 2015, the\nCompany had accruals for respirator mask/asbestos liabilities of $144 million (excluding Aearo accruals). This accrual represents the low\nend in a range of loss. The Company cannot estimate the amount or upper end of the range of amounts by which the liability may exceed the\naccrual the Company has established because of the (i) inherent difficulty in projecting the number of claims that have not yet been asserted\nor the time period in which future claims may be asserted, (ii) the complaints nearly always assert claims against multiple defendants where\nthe damages alleged are typically not attributed to individual defendants so that a defendant’s share of liability may turn on the law of joint\nand several liability, which can vary by state, (iii) the multiple factors described above that the Company considers in estimating its\nliabilities, and (iv) the several possible developments described above that may occur that could affect the Company’s estimate of liabilities.\n \nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company’s receivable for insurance recoveries related to the respirator mask/asbestos litigation was $39\nmillion. The Company estimates insurance receivables based on an analysis of its policies, including their exclusions, pertinent case law\ninterpreting comparable policies, its experience with similar claims, and an assessment of the nature of each claim and remaining coverage.\nThe Company then records an amount it has concluded is likely to be recovered. Various factors could affect the timing and amount of\nrecovery of this receivable, including (i) delays in or avoidance of payment by insurers; (ii) the extent to which insurers may become\ninsolvent in the future, and (iii) the outcome of negotiations with insurers and legal proceedings with respect to respirator mask/asbestos\nliability insurance coverage.\n \nThe Company has unresolved coverage with claims-made carriers for respirator mask claims. The Company is also seeking coverage under\nthe policies of certain insolvent insurers. Once those claims for coverage are resolved, the Company will have collected substantially all of\nits remaining insurance coverage for respirator mask/asbestos claims.\n \nRespirator Mask/Asbestos Litigation — Aearo Technologies\n \nOn April 1, 2008, a subsidiary of the Company purchased the stock of Aearo Holding Corp., the parent of Aearo Technologies (“Aearo”).\nAearo manufactured and sold various products, including personal protection equipment, such as eye, ear, head, face, fall and certain\nrespiratory protection products.\n \nAs of December 31, 2015, Aearo and/or other companies that previously owned and operated Aearo’s respirator business (American Optical\nCorporation, Warner-Lambert LLC, AO Corp. and Cabot Corporation (“Cabot”)) are named defendants, with multiple co-defendants,\nincluding the Company, in numerous lawsuits in various courts in which plaintiffs allege use of mask and respirator products and seek\ndamages from Aearo and other defendants for alleged personal injury from workplace exposures to asbestos, silica-related, or other\noccupational dusts found in products manufactured by other defendants or generally in the workplace.\n \nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company, through its Aearo subsidiary, had accruals of $21 million for product liabilities and defense costs\nrelated to current and future Aearo-related asbestos and silica-related claims. Responsibility for legal costs, as well as for settlements and\njudgments, is currently shared in an informal arrangement among Aearo, Cabot, American Optical Corporation and a subsidiary of Warner\nLambert and their respective insurers (the “Payor Group”). Liability is allocated among the parties based on the number of years each\ncompany sold respiratory products under the “AO Safety” brand and/or owned the AO Safety Division of American Optical Corporation\nand the alleged years of exposure of the individual plaintiff. Aearo’s share of the contingent liability is further limited by an agreement\nentered into between Aearo and Cabot on July 11, 1995. This agreement provides that, so long as Aearo pays to Cabot a\n105\n \nTable of Contents \nquarterly fee of $100,000, Cabot will retain responsibility and liability for, and indemnify Aearo against, any product liability claims\ninvolving exposure to asbestos, silica, or  silica products for respirators sold prior to July 11, 1995. Because of the difficulty in determining\nhow long a particular respirator remains in the stream of commerce after being sold, Aearo and Cabot have applied the agreement to claims\narising out of the alleged use of respirators involving exposure to asbestos, silica or silica products prior to January 1, 1997. With these\narrangements in place, Aearo’s potential liability is limited to exposures alleged to have arisen from the use of respirators involving\nexposure to asbestos, silica, or silica products on or after January 1, 1997. To date, Aearo has elected to pay the quarterly fee. Aearo could\npotentially be exposed to additional claims for some part of the pre-July 11, 1995 period covered by its agreement with Cabot if Aearo elects\nto discontinue its participation in this arrangement, or if Cabot is no longer able to meet its obligations in these matters.\n \nIn March 2012, Cabot CSC Corporation and Cabot Corporation filed a lawsuit against Aearo in the Superior Court of Suffolk County,\nMassachusetts seeking declaratory relief as to the scope of Cabot’s indemnity obligations under the July 11, 1995 agreement, including\nwhether Cabot has retained liability for coal workers’ pneumoconiosis claims, and seeking damages for breach of contract. In June 2014, the\ncourt granted Aearo’s motion for summary judgment on all claims. Cabot has filed a motion for reconsideration, and A\n\n--------------------------------\nAnd here is your task:\n\nExtract the exact figure (in millions) for \'Total Revenue\' or \'Net Sales\' for the year 2014.

In October 2014, the court denied Aearo’s motion for clarification.\nThe court also denied, in part, Cabot’s motion for reconsideration and reaffirmed its ruling that Cabot retained liability for claims involving\nexposure to silica in coal mine dust. The court granted Cabot’s motion, in part, ruling that Aearo was not entitled to summary judgment on\nCabot’s claim for equitable allocation, and on whether the 258 underlying claims were Cabot’s responsibility. These two issues remain in the\ncase for further proceedings. New motions for summary judgment were filed and the court heard oral arguments in October 2015.\n \nDevelopments may occur that could affect the estimate of Aearo’s liabilities.

If any of the developments described above were to occur, the actual amount of these liabilities for\nexisting and future claims could be significantly larger than the amount accrued.\n \nBecause of the inherent difficulty in projecting the number of claims that have not yet been asserted, the complexity of allocating\nresponsibility for future claims among the Payor Group, and the several possible developments that may occur that could affect the estimate\nof Aearo’s liabilities, the Company cannot estimate the amount or range of amounts by which Aearo’s liability may exceed the accrual the\nCompany has established.\n \nEnvironmental Matters and Litigation\n \nThe Company’s operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations including those pertaining to air emissions, wastewater\ndischarges, toxic substances, and the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes enforceable by national, state, and local\nauthorities around the world, and private parties in the United States and abroad. These laws and regulations provide, under certain\ncircumstances, a basis for the remediation of contamination, for restoration of or compensation for damages to natural resources, and for\npersonal injury and property damage claims. The Company has incurred, and will continue to incur, costs and capital expenditures in\ncomplying with these laws and regulations, defending personal injury and property damage claims, and modifying its business operations in\nlight of its environmental responsibilities. In its effort to satisfy its environmental responsibilities and comply with environmental laws and\nregulations, the Company has established, and periodically updates, policies relating to environmental standards of performance for its\noperations worldwide.\n \nUnder certain environmental laws, including the United States Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of\n1980 and similar state laws, the Company may be jointly and severally liable, typically with other\n106\n \nTable of Contents \ncompanies, for the costs of remediation of environmental contamination at current or former facilities and at off-site locations. The\nCompany has identified numerous locations, most of which are in the United States, at which it may have some liability. Please refer to the\nsection entitled “Environmental Liabilities and Insurance Receivables” that follows for information on the amount of the accrual.\n \nEnvironmental Matters\n \nAs previously reported, the Company has been voluntarily cooperating with ongoing reviews by local, state, federal (primarily the U.S.\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA)), and international agencies of possible environmental and health effects of various perfluorinated\ncompounds (“PFCs”), including perfluorooctanyl compounds such as perfluorooctanoate (“PFOA”) and perfluorooctane sulfonate\n(“PFOS”). As a result of its phase-out decision in May 2000, the Company no longer manufactures perfluorooctanyl compounds. The\ncompany ceased manufacturing and using the vast majority of these compounds within approximately two years of the phase-out\nannouncement, and ceased all manufacturing and the last significant use of this chemistry by the end of 2008. Through its ongoing life cycle\nmanagement and its raw material composition identification processes associated with the Company’s policies covering the use of all\npersistent and bio-accumulative materials, the Company has on occasion identified the presence of precursor chemicals in materials received\nfrom suppliers that may ultimately degrade to PFOA, PFOS, or similar compounds. Upon such identification, the Company works to find\nalternatives for such materials.\n \nRegulatory activities concerning PFOA and/or PFOS continue in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, and before certain international\nbodies. These activities include gathering of exposure and use information, risk assessment, and consideration of regulatory approaches. As\nthe database of studies of both chemicals has expanded, the EPA has developed draft human health effects documents summarizing the\navailable data from these studies. In February 2014, the EPA initiated external peer review of its draft human health effects documents for\nPFOA and PFOS. The peer review panel met in August 2014. The EPA has stated that following the peer review process it will revise its\nhealth effects documents and use them to establish lifetime health advisories for PFOS and PFOA in drinking water. Lifetime health\nadvisories, while not enforceable, serve as guidance and are benchmarks for determining if concentrations of chemicals in tap water from\npublic utilities are safe for public consumption. Once finalized, the EPA stated that the lifetime health advisories are expected to supersede\nthe provisional health advisories for PFOA and PFOS in drinking water issued by the EPA in 2009 — currently at 0.4 micrograms per liter\nfor PFOA and 0.2 micrograms per liter for PFOS. In an effort to collect exposure information under the Safe Drinking Water Act, the EPA\npublished on May 2, 2012 a list of unregulated substances, including six PFCs, required to be monitored during the period 2013-2015 by\npublic water system supplies to determine the extent of their occurrence. The EPA is reporting results from this exercise on a rolling basis\nthat will continue in 2016. Through year-end 2015, the EPA has reported results for 4,764 public water supplies nationwide. None of these\nhave reported PFOA above the provisional health advisory level issued by the EPA in 2009, and seventeen have reported PFOS levels\nabove the 2009 provisional health advisory.\n \nThe Company is continuing to make progress in its work, under the supervision of state regulators, to address its historic disposal of PFC-\ncontaining waste associated with manufacturing operations at the Decatur, Alabama, Cottage Grove, Minnesota, and Cordova, Illinois\nplants.\n \nAs previously reported, the Company entered into a voluntary remedial action agreement with the Alabama Department of Environmental\nManagement (ADEM) to address the presence of PFCs in the soil at the Company’s manufacturing facility in Decatur, Alabama. Pursuant to\na permit issued by ADEM, for approximately twenty years, the Company incorporated its wastewater treatment plant sludge containing\nPFCs in fields at its Decatur facility. After a review of the available options to address the presence of PFCs in the soil, ADEM agreed that\nthe preferred remediation option is to use a multilayer cap over the former sludge incorporation areas on the manufacturing site with\nsubsequent groundwater migration controls and treatment. Implementation of that option will continue and is expected to be completed in\n2018.\n \nThe Company continues to work with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) pursuant to the terms of the previously disclosed\nMay 2007 Settlement Agreement and Consent Order to address the presence of certain PFCs in the soil and groundwater at former disposal\nsites in Washington County, Minnesota (Oakdale and Woodbury) and at the Company’s manufacturing facility at Cottage Grove,\nMinnesota. Under this agreement, the Company’s principal obligations include (i) evaluating releases of certain PFCs from these sites and\nproposing response actions; (ii) providing\n107\n \nTable of Contents \ntreatment or alternative drinking water upon identifying any level exceeding a Health Based Value (“HBV”) or Health Risk Limit (“HRL”)\n(i.e., the amount of a chemical in drinking water determined by the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) to be safe for human\nconsumption over a lifetime) for certain PFCs  for which a HBV and/or HRL exists as a result of contamination from these sites;\n(iii) remediating identified sources of other PFCs at these sites that are not controlled by actions to remediate PFOA and PFOS; and\n(iv) sharing information with the MPCA about certain perfluorinated compounds. During 2008, the MPCA issued formal decisions adopting\nremedial options for the former disposal sites in Washington County, Minnesota (Oakdale and Woodbury). In August 2009, the MPCA\nissued a formal decision adopting remedial options for the Company’s Cottage Grove manufacturing facility.

At each location the remedial options were recommended by the Company and approved by the\nMPCA. Remediation work has been completed at the Oakdale and Woodbury sites, and they are in an operational maintenance mode.\nRemediation will continue at the Cottage Grove site during 2016.\n \nIn August 2014, the Illinois EPA approved a request by the Company to establish a groundwater management zone at its manufacturing\nfacility in Cordova, Illinois, which includes ongoing pumping of impacted site groundwater, groundwater monitoring and routine reporting\nof results.\n \nThe Company cannot predict what additional regulatory actions arising from the foregoing proceedings and activities, if any, may be taken\nregarding such compounds or the consequences of any such actions.\n \nEnvironmental Litigation\n \nAs previously reported, a former employee filed a purported class action lawsuit in 2002 in the Circuit Court of Morgan County, Alabama\n(the “St. John” case), seeking unstated damages and alleging that the plaintiffs suffered fear, increased risk, subclinical injuries, and\nproperty damage from exposure to certain perfluorochemicals at or near the Company’s Decatur, Alabama, manufacturing facility. The\ncourt in 2005 granted the Company’s motion to dismiss the named plaintiff’s personal injury-related claims on the basis that such claims are\nbarred by the exclusivity provisions of the state’s Workers Compensation Act. The plaintiffs’ counsel filed an amended complaint in\nNovember 2006, limiting the case to property damage claims on behalf of a purported class of residents and property owners in the vicinity\nof the Decatur plant. In June 2015, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint adding additional defendants, including BFI Waste\nManagement Systems of Alabama, LLC; BFI Waste Management of North America, LLC; the City of Decatur, Alabama; Morgan County,\nAlabama; Municipal Utilities Board of Decatur; and Morgan County, Alabama, d/b/a Decatur Utilities. In September 2015, the court issued\na scheduling order staying discovery pending mediation which occurred in January 2016, but did not resolve the case. Discovery relating to\nthe class certification will begin, and the class certification hearing is scheduled for November 2016.\n \nIn 2005, the judge in a second purported class action lawsuit filed by three residents of Morgan County, Alabama, seeking unstated\ncompensatory and punitive damages involving alleged damage to their property from emissions of certain perfluorochemical compounds\nfrom the Company’s Decatur, Alabama, manufacturing facility that formerly manufactured those compounds (the “Chandler” case) granted\nthe Company’s motion to abate the case, effectively putting the case on hold pending the resolution of class certification issues in the St.\nJohn case. Despite the stay, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint seeking damages for alleged personal injuries and property damage on\nbehalf of the named plaintiffs and the members of a purported class. No further action in the case is expected unless and until the stay is\nlifted.\n \nIn February 2009, a resident of Franklin County, Alabama, filed a purported class action lawsuit in the Circuit Court of Franklin County (the\n“Stover” case) seeking compensatory damages and injunctive relief based on the application by the Decatur utility’s wastewater treatment\nplant of wastewater treatment sludge to farmland and grasslands in the state that allegedly contain PFOA, PFOS and other\nperfluorochemicals. The named plaintiff seeks to represent a class of all persons within the State of Alabama who have had PFOA, PFOS,\nand other perfluorochemicals released or deposited on their property. In March 2010, the Alabama Supreme Court ordered the case\ntransferred from Franklin County to Morgan County. In May 2010, consistent with its handling of the other matters, the Morgan County\nCircuit Court abated this case, putting it on hold pending the resolution of the class certification issues in the St. John case.\n108\n \nTable of Contents \n \nIn October 2015, West Morgan-East Lawrence Water & Sewer Authority (“Water Authority”) filed an individual complaint against 3M\nCompany, Dyneon, L.L.C, and Daikin America, Inc., in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama.  The complaint also\nincludes representative plaintiffs who brought the complaint on behalf of themselves, and a class of all owners and possessors of property\nwho use water provided by the Water Authority and five local water works to which the Water Authority supplies water (collectively, the\n“Water Utilities”).  The complaint seeks compensatory and punitive damages and injunctive relief based on allegations that the defendants’\nchemicals, including PFOA and PFOS from their manufacturing processes in Decatur, have contaminated the water in the Tennessee River\nat the water intake, and that the chemicals cannot be removed by the water treatment processes utilized by the Water Authority.\n \nIn December 2010, the State of Minnesota, by its Attorney General Lori Swanson, acting in its capacity as trustee of the natural resources of\nthe State of Minnesota, filed a lawsuit in Hennepin County District Court against 3M to recover damages (including unspecified assessment\ncosts and reasonable attorney’s fees) for alleged injury to, destruction of, and loss of use of certain of the State’s natural resources under the\nMinnesota Environmental Response and Liability Act (MERLA) and the Minnesota Water Pollution Control Act (MWPCA), as well as\nstatutory nuisance and common law claims of trespass, nuisance, and negligence with respect to the presence of PFCs in the groundwater,\nsurface water, fish or other aquatic life, and sediments (the “NRD Lawsuit”). The State also seeks declarations under MERLA that 3M is\nresponsible for all damages the State may suffer in the future for injuries to natural resources from releases of PFCs into the environment,\nand under MWPCA that 3M is responsible for compensation for future loss or destruction of fish, aquatic life, and other damages.\n \nIn November 2011, the Metropolitan Council filed a motion to intervene and a complaint in the NRD Lawsuit seeking compensatory\ndamages and other legal, declaratory and equitable relief, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, for costs and fees that the Metropolitan\nCouncil alleges it will be required to assess at some time in the future if the MPCA imposes restrictions on Metropolitan Council’s PFOS\ndischarges to the Mississippi River, including the installation and maintenance of a water treatment system. The Metropolitan Council’s\nintervention motion was based on several theories, including common law negligence, and statutory claims under MERLA for response\ncosts, and under the Minnesota Environmental Rights Act (MERA) for declaratory and equitable relief against 3M for PFOS and other PFC\npollution of the waters and sediments of the Mississippi River. 3M did not object to the motion to intervene. In January 2012, 3M answered\nthe Metropolitan Council’s complaint and filed a counterclaim alleging that the Metropolitan Council discharges PFCs to the Mississippi\nRiver and discharges PFC-containing sludge and bio solids from one or more of its wastewater treatment plants onto agricultural lands and\nlocal area landfills. Accordingly, 3M requested that if the court finds that the State is entitled to any of the damages the State seeks, 3M\nseeks contribution and apportionment from the Metropolitan Council, including attorneys’ fees, under MERLA, and contribution from and\nliability for the Metropolitan Council’s proportional share of damages awarded to the State under the MWPCA, as well as under statutory\nnuisance and common law theories of trespass, nuisance, and negligence. 3M also seeks declaratory relief under MERA.\n \nIn April 2012, 3M filed a motion to disqualify the State of Minnesota’s counsel, Covington & Burling, LLP (Covington). In October 2012,\nthe court granted 3M’s motion to disqualify Covington as counsel to the State and the State and Covington appealed the court’s\ndisqualification to the Minnesota Court of Appeals. In July 2013, the Minnesota Court of Appeals affirmed the district court’s\ndisqualification order. In October 2013, the Minnesota Supreme Court granted both the State’s and Covington’s petition for review of the\ndecision of the Minnesota Court of Appeals. In April 2014, the Minnesota Supreme Court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded\nthe case to the district court for further proceedings. The district court took evidence on the disqualification issues at a hearing in October\n2015. In February 2016, the district court ruled that Covington violated the professional ethics rule against representing a client (here the\nState of Minnesota) in the same or substantially related matter where that person’s interests are materially adverse to the interests of a\nformer client (3M). The district court, however, denied 3M’s motion to disqualify Covington because it further found that 3M impliedly\nwaived by delaying to assert the conflict. 3M is reviewing the district court’s opinion to determine next steps. Other activity in the case had\nbeen stayed pending the outcome of the disqualification issue.

For those matters for which a liability has not been recorded, the Company\nbelieves any such liability is not probable and estimable and the Company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss at this time.\n \nEnvironmental Liabilities and Insurance Receivables\n \nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company had recorded liabilities of $43 million for estimated “environmental remediation” costs based upon\nan evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site and also recorded related insurance receivables of $11 million.\nThe Company records liabilities for remediation costs on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally\nno later than the completion of feasibility studies or the Company’s commitment to a plan of action. Liabilities for estimated costs of\nenvironmental remediation, depending on the site, are based primarily upon internal or third-party environmental studies, and estimates as\nto the number, participation level and financial viability of any other potentially responsible parties, the extent of the contamination and the\nnature of required remedial actions. The Company adjusts recorded liabilities as further information develops or circumstances change. The\nCompany expects that it will pay the amounts recorded over the periods of remediation for the applicable sites, currently ranging up to 20\nyears.\n \nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company had recorded liabilities of $35 million for “other environmental liabilities” based upon an\nevaluation of currently available facts to implement the Settlement Agreement and Consent Order with the MPCA, the remedial action\nagreement with ADEM, and to address trace amounts of perfluorinated compounds in drinking water sources in the City of Oakdale,\nMinnesota, as well as presence in the soil and groundwater at the Company’s manufacturing facilities in Decatur, Alabama, and Cottage\nGrove, Minnesota, and at two former disposal sites in Washington County, Minnesota (Oakdale and Woodbury). The Company expects that\nmost of the spending will occur over the next four years. As of December 31, 2015, the Company’s receivable for insurance recoveries\nrelated to “other environmental liabilities” was $15 million.\n \nIt is difficult to estimate the cost of environmental compliance and remediation given the uncertainties regarding the interpretation and\nenforcement of applicable environmental laws and regulations, the extent of environmental contamination and the existence of alternative\ncleanup methods. Developments may occur that could affect the Company’s current assessment, including, but not limited to: (i) changes in\nthe information available regarding the environmental impact of the Company’s operations and products; (ii) changes in environmental\nregulations, changes in permissible levels of specific compounds in drinking water sources, or changes in enforcement theories and policies,\nincluding efforts to recover natural resource damages; (iii) new and evolving analytical and remediation techniques; (iv) success in\nallocating liability to other potentially responsible parties; and (v) the financial viability of other potentially responsible parties and third-\nparty indemnitors. For sites included in both “environmental remediation liabilities” and “other environmental liabilities,” at which\nremediation activity is largely complete and remaining activity relates primarily to operation and maintenance of the remedy, including\nrequired post-remediation monitoring, the Company believes the exposure to loss in excess of the amount accrued would not be material to\nthe Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition. However, for locations at which remediation activity is largely\nongoing, the Company cannot estimate a possible loss or range of loss in excess of the associated established accruals for the reasons\ndescribed above.\n \nOther Matters\n \nCommercial Litigation\n \n3M sued TransWeb Corporation in Minnesota in 2010 for infringement of several 3M patents covering fluorination and hydrocharging of\nfilter media used in 3M’s respirators and furnace filters. TransWeb filed a declaratory judgment action in and successfully moved the\nlitigation to the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, seeking a declaration of invalidity and non-infringement of 3M’s patents,\nand further alleging that 3M waited too long to enforce its rights. TransWeb also alleged 3M obtained the patents through inequitable\nconduct and that 3M’s attempt to enforce the patents constituted a violation of the antitrust laws. In November 2012, a jury returned a\nverdict in favor of TransWeb on all but\n110\n \nTable of Contents \none count, including findings that 3M’s patents were invalid and not infringed, and that 3M had committed an antitrust violation by seeking\nto enforce a patent it had obtained fraudulently. The jury also recommended that the court find 3M had committed inequitable conduct in\nobtaining the patents, and that the patents were therefore unenforceable. Since the vast majority of TransWeb’s claim for treble antitrust\ndamages was in the form of its attorneys’ fees and expenses in connection with the defense of the patent case, the parties agreed that the\nmeasure of damages would not go to the jury, but rather would be submitted to a special master after the trial.  In April, 2014, the court\nissued an order denying 3M’s motions to set aside the jury’s verdict. In addition, the court found two 3M patents unenforceable due to\ninequitable conduct. The court accepted the special master’s recommendation as to the amount of attorneys’ fees to be awarded as damages,\nand entered judgment against 3M in the amount of approximately $26 million. In July 2014, 3M filed a notice of appeal of the judgment to\nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On February 10, 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued its\ndecision affirming the lower court’s judgment. 3M is reviewing the appellate court’s decision to determine next steps. The impact of the\nappellate court’s decision is not material to the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition.\n \nProduct Liability Litigation\n \nÉlectricité de France (EDF) filed a lawsuit against 3M France in the French courts in 2006 claiming commercial loss and property damage\nafter experiencing electrical network failures which EDF claims were caused by allegedly defective 3M transition splices. The French Court\nof Appeals at Versailles affirmed the commercial trial court’s decision that the transition splices conformed to contract specifications and\nthat EDF thoroughly analyzed and tested the splices before purchase and installation. The Court of Appeals, however, ordered a court-\nappointed expert to study the problem and issue a technical opinion on the cause of the network failures. The court-appointed expert\nsubmitted his report to the commercial court in May 2014. The expert found potential defects in 3M’s product and found that EDF incurred\ndamages in excess of 100 million Euros. The expert’s opinion is not dispositive of liability or damages and is subject to numerous factual\nand legal challenges that will be raised with the court. The parties are briefing the court on their respective positions. Once the briefing is\ncomplete, the commercial court may take from six months to one year to render its decision.\n \nOne customer obtained an order in the French courts against 3M Purification SAS (a French subsidiary) in October 2011 appointing an\nexpert to determine the amount of commercial loss and property damage allegedly caused by allegedly defective 3M filters used in the\ncustomer’s manufacturing process. An Austrian subsidiary of this same customer also filed a claim against 3M Austria GmbH (an Austrian\nsubsidiary) and 3M Purification SAS in the Austrian courts in September 2012 seeking damages for the same issue. Those two cases are still\npending. Another customer filed a lawsuit against 3M Deutschland GmbH (a German subsidiary) in the German courts in March 2012\nseeking commercial loss and property damage allegedly caused by the same 3M filters used in that customer’s manufacturing process; the\nCompany has resolved the claims in the German litigation. The Company has also settled without litigation the claims of two other\ncustomers arising out of the same issue. The amounts paid are not material to the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial\ncondition.\n \nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company is a named defendant in 122 lawsuits, most of which are pending in federal or state court in\nMinnesota, in which the plaintiffs claim they underwent various joint arthroplasty, cardiovascular, and other surgeries and later developed\nsurgical site infections due to the use of the Bair Hugger™ patient warming system.  The U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation\ngranted the plaintiffs’ motion to transfer and consolidate all cases pending in federal courts to the U.S. District Court for the District of\nMinnesota to be managed in a multi-district proceeding during the pre-trial phase of the litigation.\n \nThe Bair Hugger™ product line was acquired by 3M as part of the 2010 acquisition of Arizant, Inc., a leading manufacturer of patient\nwarming solutions designed to prevent hypothermia and maintain normal body temperature in surgical settings. No liability has been\nrecorded for this matter because the Company believes that any such liability is not probable and estimable at this time.\n \nFor product liability litigation matters described in this section for which a liability has been recorded, the Company believes the amount\nrecorded is not material to the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition.\n111\n \nTable of Contents \nIn addition, the Company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss in excess of the established accruals at this time.\n \n NOT\n\n--------------------------------\nAnd here is your task:\n\nExtract the exact figure (in millions) for \'Total Revenue\' or \'Net Sales\' for the year 2014.

Stock-Based Compensation\n \nThe 3M 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan provides for the issuance or delivery of up to 100 million shares of 3M common stock (including\nadditional shareholder approvals subsequent to 2008) pursuant to awards granted under the plan. Awards under this plan may be issued in\nthe form of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, progressive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock,\nrestricted stock units, other stock awards, and performance units and performance shares. Awards denominated in shares of common stock\nother than options and stock appreciation rights, per the 2008 Plan, count against the 100 million share limit as 3.38 shares for every one\nshare covered by such award (for full value awards with grant dates prior to May 11, 2010), as 2.87 shares for every one share covered by\nsuch award (for full value awards with grant dates on or after May 11, 2010, and prior to May 8, 2012), or as 3.50 shares for every one share\ncovered by such award (for full value awards with grant dates of May 8, 2012 or later). The remaining total shares available for grant under\nthe 2008 Long Term Incentive Plan Program are 20,328,681 as of December 31, 2015. There were approximately 9,200 participants with\noutstanding options, restricted stock, or restricted stock units at December 31, 2015.\n \nThe Company’s annual stock option and restricted stock unit grant is made in February to provide a strong and immediate link between the\nperformance of individuals during the preceding year and the size of their annual stock compensation grants. The grant to eligible employees\nuses the closing stock price on the grant date. Accounting rules require recognition of expense under a non-substantive vesting period\napproach, requiring compensation expense recognition when an employee is eligible to retire. Employees are considered eligible to retire at\nage 55 and after having completed five years of service. This retiree-eligible population represents 35 percent of the 2015 annual stock-\nbased compensation award expense dollars; therefore, higher stock-based compensation expense is recognized in the first quarter. 3M also\nhas granted progressive (reload) options. These options are nonqualified stock options that were granted to certain participants under the\n1997 or 2002 Management Stock Ownership Program, but for which the reload feature was eliminated in 2005 (on a prospective basis only).\n \nIn addition to the annual grants, the Company makes other minor grants of stock options, restricted stock units and other stock-based grants.\nThe Company issues cash settled restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights in certain countries. These grants do not result in the\nissuance of common stock and are considered immaterial by the Company.\n \nAmounts recognized in the financial statements with respect to stock-based compensation programs, which include stock options, restricted\nstock, restricted stock units, performance shares, and the General Employees’ Stock Purchase Plan (GESPP), are provided in the following\ntable. Capitalized stock-based compensation amounts were not material for the years ended 2015, 2014 and 2013.\n \nStock-Based Compensation Expense\n \n \n \nYears ended December 31\n \n(Millions)\n    \n2015\n    \n2014\n    \n2013\n \nCost of sales\n $\n46  $\n47  $\n27  \nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n  \n185   \n192   \n183  \nResearch, development and related expenses\n  \n45   \n41   \n30  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nStock-based compensation expenses\n $\n276  $\n280  $\n240  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nIncome tax benefits\n $\n(87) $\n(79) $\n(71) \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nStock-based compensation expenses, net of tax\n $\n189  $\n201  $\n169  \n \n112\n \nTable of Contents \nStock Option Program\n \nThe following table summarizes stock option activity for the years ended December 31:\n \n \n \n2015\n \n2014\n \n2013\n \n \n    \n \n    \nWeighted\n    \n \n    \nWeighted\n    \n \n    \nWeighted\n \n \n \nNumber of\n \nAverage\n \nNumber of\n \nAverage\n \nNumber of\n \nAverage\n \n \n \nOptions\n Exercise Price  \nOptions\n Exercise Price  \nOptions\n Exercise Price  \nUnder option —\n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n  \nJanuary 1\n \n39,235,557  $\n90.38  \n43,938,778  $\n83.84  \n56,565,030  $\n80.33  \nGranted:\n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n  \nAnnual\n \n5,529,544  \n \n165.91  \n5,736,183  \n \n126.77  \n6,220,810   \n101.55  \nProgressive (Reload)\n \n—  \n \n—  \n —  \n \n —  \n140,447   \n109.83  \nOther\n \n—  \n \n—  \n —  \n \n —  \n191   \n119.62  \nExercised\n \n(5,978,382) \n \n83.74  \n(10,219,261) \n \n82.37  \n(18,825,218)  \n79.25  \nCanceled\n \n(234,274) \n \n128.99  \n(220,143) \n \n105.11  \n(162,482)  \n89.92  \nDecember 31\n \n38,552,445  $\n102.01  \n39,235,557  $\n90.38  \n43,938,778  $\n83.84  \nOptions exercisable\n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n  \nDecember 31\n \n27,262,062  $\n85.97  \n27,502,208  $\n81.42  \n32,038,228  $\n79.58  \n \nStock options vest over a period from one to three years with the expiration date at 10 years from date of grant.

As of December 31, 2015, there was $69 million of compensation expense that has yet to be\nrecognized related to non-vested stock option based awards. This expense is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average\nvesting period of 21 months. For options outstanding at December 31, 2015, the weighted-average remaining contractual life was 66 months\nand the aggregate intrinsic value was $1.958 billion. For options exercisable at December 31, 2015, the weighted-average remaining\ncontractual life was 52 months and the aggregate intrinsic value was $1.763 billion.\n \nThe total intrinsic values of stock options exercised during 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $465 million, $615 million and $562 million,\nrespectively. Cash received from options exercised during 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $501 million, $842 million and $1.492 billion,\nrespectively. The Company’s actual tax benefits realized for the tax deductions related to the exercise of employee stock options for 2015,\n2014 and 2013 was $172 million, $226 million and $208 million, respectively.\n \nThe Company does not have a specific policy to repurchase common shares to mitigate the dilutive impact of options; however, the\nCompany has historically made adequate discretionary purchases, based on cash availability, market trends, and other factors, to satisfy\nstock option exercise activity.\n \nFor annual and progressive (reload) options, the weighted average fair value at the date of grant was calculated using the Black-Scholes\noption-pricing model and the assumptions that follow.

The total fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units that vested during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and\n2013 was $166 million, $145 million and $114 million, respectively.

Since the rights to dividends are forfeitable, there is no impact on basic earnings per share calculations.\nWeighted average restricted stock unit shares outstanding are included in the computation of diluted earnings per share.\n \nPerformance Shares\n \nInstead of restricted stock units, the Company makes annual grants of performance shares to members of its executive management. The\n2015 performance criteria for these performance shares (organic volume growth, return on invested capital, free cash flow conversion, and\nearnings per share growth) were selected because the Company believes that they are important drivers of long-term stockholder value. The\nnumber of shares of 3M common stock that could actually be delivered at the end of the three-year performance period may be anywhere\nfrom 0% to 200% of each performance share granted, depending on the performance of the Company during such performance period. Non-\nsubstantive vesting requires that expense for the performance shares be recognized over one or three years depending on when each\nindividual became a 3M executive. Performance shares do not accrue dividends during the performance period. Therefore, the grant date\nfair value is determined by reducing the closing stock price on the date of grant by the net present value of dividends during the performance\nperiod.\n \n114\n \nTable of Contents \nThe following table summarizes performance share activity for the years ended December 31:\n \n \n \n2015\n \n2014\n \n2013\n \n \n    \n    \n    Weighted     \n    \n    Weighted     \n    \n    Weighted  \n \n \n \n \nAverage\n \n \n \nAverage\n \n \n \nAverage\n \n \n \nNumber of\n Grant Date  \nNumber of\n Grant Date  \nNumber of\n Grant Date  \n \n \nAwards\n \nFair Value  \nAwards\n Fair Value  \nAwards\n Fair Value  \nUndistributed balance —\n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n  \nAs of January 1\n \n1,099,752  $\n102.65  \n895,635  $\n88.12  \n1,089,084  $\n79.27  \nGranted\n \n227,798  \n \n158.88  \n305,225  \n \n124.89  \n353,734   \n96.87  \nDistributed\n \n(323,938) \n \n83.08  \n(277,358) \n \n84.74  \n(507,083)  \n75.16  \nPerformance change\n \n(106,760) \n \n127.70  \n212,461  \n \n109.74  \n(6,949)  \n77.01  \nForfeited\n \n(25,660) \n \n125.33  \n(36,212) \n \n109.44  \n(33,151)  \n91.34  \nAs of December 31\n \n871,192  $\n120.89  \n1,099,752  $\n102.65  \n895,635  $\n88.12  \n \nAs of December 31, 2015, there was $17 million of compensation expense that has yet to be recognized related to performance shares.

Business Segments\n \n3M’s businesses are organized, managed and internally grouped into segments based on differences in markets, products, technologies and\nservices. 3M manages its operations in five business segments: Industrial; Safety and Graphics; Health Care; Electronics and Energy; and\nConsumer. 3M’s five business segments bring together common or related 3M technologies, enhancing the development of innovative\nproducts and services and providing for efficient sharing of business resources. Transactions among reportable segments are recorded at\ncost. 3M is an integrated enterprise characterized by substantial intersegment cooperation, cost allocations and inventory transfers.\nTherefore, management does not represent that these segments, if operated independently, would report the operating income information\nshown. The difference between operating income and pre-tax income relates to interest income and interest expense, which are not allocated\nto business segments.\n115\n \nTable of Contents \n \nEffective in the third quarter of 2015, within the Health Care business segment, the Company formed the Oral Care Solutions Division,\nwhich combined the former 3M ESPE and 3M Unitek divisions.\n \nBusiness Segment Products\n \nBusiness Segment\n    \nMajor Products\nIndustrial\n \nTapes, coated, nonwoven and bonded abrasives, adhesives, advanced ceramics, sealants, specialty\nmaterials, filtration products, closure systems for personal hygiene products, acoustic systems products,\nautomotive components, abrasion-resistant films, structural adhesives and paint finishing and detailing\nproducts\n \n \n \nSafety and Graphics\n \nPersonal protection products, traffic safety and security products, commercial graphics systems,\ncommercial cleaning and protection products, floor matting, roofing granules for asphalt shingles, and fall\nprotection products\n \n \n \nHealth Care\n \nMedical and surgical supplies, skin health and infection prevention products, drug delivery systems, dental\nand orthodontic products, health information systems and food safety products\n \n \n \nElectronics and Energy\n \nOptical films solutions for electronic displays, packaging and interconnection devices, insulating and\nsplicing solutions for the electronics, telecommunications and electrical industries, touch screens and\ntouch monitors, renewable energy component solutions, and infrastructure protection products\n \n \n \nConsumer\n \nSponges, scouring pads, high-performance cloths, consumer and office tapes, repositionable notes,\nindexing systems, construction and home improvement products, home care products, protective material\nproducts, and consumer and office tapes and adhesives\n \nBusiness Segment Information\n \n \n \nNet Sales\n \nOperating Income\n \n(Millions)\n    \n2015\n    \n2014\n    \n2013\n    \n2015\n    \n2014\n    \n2013\n \nIndustrial\n $\n10,328  $\n10,990  $\n10,657  $\n2,263  $\n2,389  $\n2,307  \nSafety and Graphics\n  \n5,515   \n5,732   \n5,584   \n1,305   \n1,296   \n1,227  \nHealth Care\n  \n5,420   \n5,572   \n5,334   \n1,724   \n1,724   \n1,672  \nElectronics and Energy\n  \n5,220   \n5,604   \n5,393   \n1,102   \n1,115   \n954  \nConsumer\n  \n4,422   \n4,523   \n4,435   \n1,046   \n995   \n945  \nCorporate and Unallocated\n  \n1   \n4   \n8   \n(355)  \n(251)  \n(321) \nElimination of Dual Credit\n  \n(632)  \n(604)  \n(540)  \n(139)  \n(133)  \n(118) \nTotal Company\n $\n30,274  $\n31,821  $\n30,871  $\n6,946  $\n7,135  $\n6,666  \n \n \n \nAssets\n \nDepreciation & Amortization\n \nCapital Expenditures\n \n(Millions)\n    \n2015\n    \n2014\n    \n2013\n    \n2015\n    \n2014\n    \n2013\n    \n2015\n    \n2014\n    \n2013\n \nIndustrial\n $\n9,203  $\n8,508  $\n8,833  $\n374  $\n383  $\n373  $\n317  $\n395  $\n511  \nSafety and Graphics\n  \n7,564   \n4,939   \n5,122   \n245  \n \n234  \n \n255   \n199   \n221   \n207  \nHealth Care\n  \n4,403   \n4,344   \n4,329   \n179  \n \n181  \n \n171   \n168   \n169   \n120  \nElectronics and Energy\n  \n4,815   \n5,116   \n5,336   \n291  \n \n271  \n \n260   \n211   \n232   \n261  \nConsumer\n  \n2,393   \n2,434   \n2,516   \n108  \n \n108  \n \n106   \n124   \n111   \n128  \nCorporate and Unallocated\n  \n4,340   \n5,868   \n7,168   \n238  \n \n231  \n \n206   \n442   \n365   \n438  \nTotal Company\n $ 32,718  $ 31,209  $ 33,304  $\n1,435  $\n1,408  $\n1,371  $ 1,461  $ 1,493  $\n1,665  \n \nCorporate and unallocated operating income includes a variety of miscellaneous items, such as corporate investment gains and losses,\ncertain derivative gains and losses, certain insurance-related gains and losses, certain litigation and environmental expenses, corporate\nrestructuring charges and certain under- or over-absorbed costs (e.g. pension, stock-based compensation) that the Company may choose not\nto allocate directly to its business segments. Because this category includes a variety of miscellaneous items, it is subject to fluctuation on a\nquarterly and annual basis.\n \n116\n \nTable of Contents \n3M business segment reporting measures include dual credit to business segments for certain U.S. sales and related operating income.\nManagement evaluates each of its five business segments based on net sales and operating income performance, including dual credit U.S.\nreporting to further incentivize U.S. sales growth. As a result, 3M provides additional (“dual”) credit to those business segments selling\nproducts in the U.S. to an external customer when that segment is not the primary seller of the product. For example, certain respirators are\nprimarily sold by the Personal Safety Division within the Safety and Graphics business segment; however, the Industrial business segment\nalso sells this product to certain customers in its U.S. markets.

In this example, the non-primary selling segment (Industrial) would also\nreceive credit for the associated net sales it initiated and the related approximate operating income. The assigned operating income related to\ndual credit activity may differ from operating income that would result from actual costs associated with such sales. The offset to the dual\ncredit business segment reporting is reflected as a reconciling item entitled “Elimination of Dual Credit,” such that sales and operating\nincome for the U.S. in total are unchanged.\n \n NOTE 17.

The Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including the Chief\nExecutive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s “disclosure controls and\nprocedures” (as defined in the Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation,\nthe Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective.\n \nb. The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial\nreporting, as defined in the Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Management conducted an assessment of the Company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting based on the framework established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in\nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013). Based on the assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2015, the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting is effective. Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 excluded Capital Safety Group S.A.R.L. and Polypore International, Inc.’s\nSeparation Media Business, which were both acquired by the Company in August 2015 in purchase business combinations. These acquired\nbusinesses’ total assets and total net sales, in the aggregate, represented less than 2 percent and less than 1 percent, respectively, of the\nCompany’s consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015. Companies are allowed to exclude\nacquisitions from their assessment of internal control over financial reporting during the first year of acquisition while integrating the\nacquired company under guidelines established by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company’s internal control over financial\nreporting as of December 31, 2015 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as\nstated in their report which is included herein, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015.\n \nc. There was no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company’s most recently\ncompleted fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting.\n \nThe Company is implementing an enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system on a worldwide basis, which is expected to improve the\nefficiency of certain financial and related transaction processes. The gradual implementation is expected to occur in phases over the next\nseveral years. The implementation of a worldwide ERP system will likely affect the processes that constitute our internal control over\nfinancial reporting and will require testing for effectiveness.\n \nThe Company completed implementation with respect to elements of certain processes/sub-processes in limited subsidiaries/locations and\nwill continue to roll-out the ERP system over the next several years. As with any new information technology application we implement,\nthis application, along with the internal controls over financial reporting included in this process, was appropriately considered within the\ntesting for effectiveness with respect to the implementation in these instances. We concluded, as part of our evaluation described in the\nabove paragraphs, that the implementation of ERP in these circumstances has not materially affected our internal control over financial\nreporting.\n \nItem 9B.

If the Committee shall stipulate terms and conditions with respect to such Stock Awards, the terms and conditions will\nbe set forth in the documents evidencing the Award.  If the terms and conditions with respect to any Stock Award shall require the surrender\nor forfeiture of other grants or rights under this Plan or any other employee benefit or compensation plan of the Company, then the\nParticipant shall not have any rights under such Stock Award until the grants or rights exchanged have been fully and effectively\nsurrendered or forfeited.\n \n(h)\nPerformance Units and Performance Shares – At the time it approves each grant of Performance Units or Performance\nShares, the Committee shall determine the number of Performance Units or Performance Shares granted to each Participant, the proration, if\nany, of such Performance Units or Performance Shares if the Participant retires prior to the completion of the relevant Performance Period,\nthe commencement and expiration of the relevant Performance Period, and the Performance Criteria by which the payment value of the\nPerformance Units or Performance Shares will be determined.

Any such Dividend Equivalents shall be converted to cash or additional shares of Common Stock, or a combination of cash and\nshares of Common Stock, by such formula and at such time and subject to such limitations as may be set forth in the written agreement\nevidencing the award.  Payment of each Performance Unit and Performance Share shall occur no later than the March 15 of the year\nimmediately following the completion of the respective Performance Period, unless a Participant shall have made an effective election to\ndefer the receipt of such payment pursuant to the terms of an applicable deferred compensation plan and all applicable laws.  The amount\npayable with respect to each Performance Unit and Performance Share shall be contingent upon the attainment of the Performance Criteria\nselected by the Committee during the respective Performance Period, and upon the continued employment of the Participant throughout\nsuch Performance Period (or upon the Participant’s Retirement prior to the end of such Performance Period).\n \n6.\nPayment of Awards.\n \nPayment of Awards may be in the form of cash, s\n\n--------------------------------\nAnd here is your task:\n\nExtract the exact figure (in millions) for \'Total Revenue\' or \'Net Sales\' for the year 2014.

If the Committee shall stipulate Conditions with respect to such Stock Awards, the Conditions will be set forth in\ndocuments evidencing the grant.  If Conditions with respect to such Stock Awards shall require the surrender or forfeiture of other grants or\nrights under this Program or any other employee benefit or compensation plan of the Company, then the Participant shall not have any\nrights under such Stock Awards until the grants or rights exchanged have been fully and effectively surrendered or forfeited.\n \nSECTION 7  SETTLEMENT OF AWARDS\n(a)\nPayment of Awards may be in the form of cash, Common Stock or combinations thereof as the Committee shall\ndetermine, and with such other restrictions as it may impose.  The Committee may also require or permit Participants to elect to defer the\nissuance of shares or the settlement of Awards in cash under such rules and procedures as it may establish under the 2005 Program.  It may\nalso provide that deferred settlements include the payment or crediting of interest on the deferral amounts denominated in cash or the\npayment or crediting of Dividend Equivalents on deferred settlements denominated in shares.\n \n(b)\n No shares of Common Stock shall be issued to any Participant upon the exercise of an Option until full payment of the\npurchase price has been made to the Company and the Participant has remitted to the Company the required federal and state withholding\ntaxes, if any.  A Participant shall obtain no rights as a stockholder until certificates for such stock are issued to the Participant or delivered to\nthe MSOP Administrator for credit to the account of the Participant.  Payment of the purchase price or applicable withholding taxes, if any,\nmay be made in whole, or in part, in shares of Common Stock, pursuant to such terms and conditions as may be established from time to\ntime by the Committee.  If payment is made in shares of Common Stock, such stock shall be valued at one hundred percent (100%) of their\nFair Market Value on the day the Participant exercised his or her Option or, as regards a withholding tax, such other date when the tax\nwithholding obligation becomes due.  A Participant need not surrender shares of Common Stock as payment; and the Company may, upon\nthe giving of satisfactory evidence of ownership of said Common Stock by Participant, deliver the appropriate number of additional shares\nof Common Stock reduced by the number of shares required to pay the purchase price and any applicable withholding taxes.  Such form of\nevidence shall be determined by the Committee.\n \nSECTION 8  DELIVERY OF STOCK CERTIFICATES\n \n(a)\nWithin sixty (60) days after completion of the exercise of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right, or the complete\nsatisfaction of Conditions applicable to a Stock Award, the Company will have delivered to the Participant or to the MSOP Administrator\nfo\n\n--------------------------------\nAnd here is your task:\n\nExtract the exact figure (in millions) for \'Total Revenue\' or \'Net Sales\' for the year 2014.

At the conclusion of such ninety-day period (with respect to the Participant’s Options and Stock Appreciation\nRights, and at the time of termination with respect to any other Awards), participation hereunder shall cease and all of the Participant’s\nAwards granted under this 2005 Program shall be automatically forfeited unless the documents evidencing such Options or Stock\nAppreciation Rights provide otherwise.\n \n6\n \n \n(b)\nIf a Participant Retires, terminates employment with the Company and in connection with such termination the Participant\nexecutes a written release of employment-related claims in favor of the Company that provides (with the approval of the Company) for the\nnonforfeiture of Options and Stock Appreciation Rights, or changes employment status as a result of a physical or mental disability as\nrecognized under a benefit plan maintained by the Company, without having fully exercised an Option or Stock Appreciation Right, the\nParticipant shall be entitled, within the remaining term of the Option or Stock Appreciation Right (but not beyond the expiration date of\nsuch Option or Right), to exercise such Option or Stock Appreciation Right (provided, however, that in the event of a termination in\nconnection with which the Participant executes a written release of employment-related claims in favor of the Company that provides (with\nthe approval of the Company) for the nonforfeiture of Options and Stock Appreciation Rights, the additional time to exercise Options and\nStock Appreciation Rights shall apply only to those Options and Stock Appreciation Rights which have vested prior to the date of\ntermination of employment).

Note 1 to the financial statements describes a change in\naccounting principle from a method which classifies marketable securities on the consolidated balance sheet based on management’s\nintended holding period to a method which classifies marketable securities based on the nature of the securities and their availability\nfor use in current operations.  It should be understood that the preferability of one acceptable method of accounting over another for the\nclassification of marketable securities has not been addressed in any authoritative accounting literature, and in expressing our\nconcurrence below we have relied on management’s determination that this change in accounting principle is preferable.  Based on our\nreading of management’s stated reasons and justification for this change in accounting principle in the Form 10-K, and our discussions\nwith management as to their judgment about the relevant business planning factors relating to the change, we concur with management\nthat such change represents, in the Company’s circumstances, the adoption of a preferable accounting principle in conformity with\nAccounting Standards Codification 250, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections.\n \nVery truly yours,\n \n \n \n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\n \n EXHIBIT 21\n \n3M COMPANY AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES (PARENT AND SUBSIDIARIES)\nAS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015\n \nName of Company\n \nOrganized Under Law of\nRegistrant — 3M Company\n \nDelaware\nConsolidated subsidiaries of the Registrant:\n \n \n3M Cogent, Inc.\n \nDelaware\n3M Electronic Monitoring, Inc.\n \nDelaware\n3M Financial Management Company\n \nDelaware\n3M Global Channel Services, Inc.\n \nDelaware\n3M Innovative Properties Company\n \nDelaware\n3M Investment Management Corporation\n \nDelaware\n3M Occupational Safety LLC\n \nDelaware\n3M Purification Inc.\n \nDelaware\nAearo Holding LLC\n \nDelaware\nAearo Technologies LLC\n \nDelaware\nCapital Safety North America Holdings, Inc.\n \nDelaware\nCeradyne, Inc.\n \nDelaware\n3M Unitek Corporation\n \nCalifornia\nIvera Medical LLC\n \nCalifornia\nMeguiar’s, Inc.\n \nCalifornia\n3M Health Information Systems, Inc.\n \nMaryland\n3M Touch Systems, Inc.\n \nMassachusetts\nGTA-NHT, Inc.\n \nMassachusetts\nDB Industries LLC\n \nMinnesota\nTwo Harbors Insurance Company\n \nSouth Carolina\n3M Argentina S.A.C.I.F.I.A\n \nArgentina\n3M Australia Pty.

Changes in applicable exchange rates or exchange\nmechanisms may continue in the future. These changes could impact the rate of exchange applicable to remeasure the Company’s net\nmonetary assets (liabilities) denominated in Venezuelan Bolivars (VEF). As of\n55\n \nTable of Contents \nDecember 31, 2015, the Company had a balance of net monetary liabilities denominated in VEF of less than 500 million VEF and the\nCENCOEX, SICAD (formerly SICAD1), and SIMADI exchange rates were approximately 6 VEF, 13 VEF, and 200 VEF per U.S. dollar,\nrespectively.\n \nA need to deconsolidate the Company’s Venezuelan subsidiary’s operations may result from a lack of exchangeability of VEF-denominated\ncash coupled with an acute degradation in the ability to make key operational decisions due to government regulations in Venezuela. 3M\nmonitors factors such as its ability to access various exchange mechanisms; the impact of government regulations on the Company’s ability\nto manage its Venezuelan subsidiary’s capital structure, purchasing, product pricing, and labor relations; and the current political and\neconomic situation within Venezuela. Based upon such factors as of December 31, 2015, the Company continues to consolidate its\nVenezuelan subsidiary. As of December 31, 2015, the balance of intercompany receivables due from this subsidiary and its equity balance\nare not significant.\n \nReclassifications: Certain amounts in the prior years’ consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year\npresentation.\n \nUse of estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent\nassets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.\nActual results could differ from these estimates.\n \nCash and cash equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and temporary investments with maturities of three months or less\nwhen acquired.\n \nMarketable securities: Effective December 31, 2015, the Company changed the method of classification of certain securities previously\nclassified as non-current to current. This new method classifies these securities as current or non-current based on the nature of the securities\nand availability for use in current operations while the prior classification was based on management’s intended holding period, the\nsecurity’s maturity date and liquidity considerations based on market conditions. The Company believes this method is preferable because it\nis consistent with how the Company manages its capital structure and liquidity. The prior period balance has been reclassified to conform to\nthe current year presentation:\n \n \nDecember 31, 2014\n \n(Millions)\n    Previously Reported     \nImpact\n    \nAs Adjusted\n \nMarketable securities - current\n $\n626  $\n813  $\n1,439  \nMarketable securities - non-current\n  \n828   \n(813)  \n15  \nTotal marketable securities\n $\n1,454  $\n —  $\n1,454  \n \n3M reviews impairments associated with its marketable securities in accordance with the measurement guidance provided by ASC\n320, Investments-Debt and Equity Securities, when determining the classification of the impairment as “temporary” or “other-than-\ntemporary”. A temporary impairment charge results in an unrealized loss being recorded in the other comprehensive income component of\nshareholders’ equity. Such an unrealized loss does not reduce net income for the applicable accounting period because the loss is not viewed\nas other-than-temporary. The factors evaluated to differentiate between temporary and other-than-temporary include the projected future\ncash flows, credit ratings actions, and assessment of the credit quality of the underlying collateral, as well as other factors.\n \nInvestments: Investments primarily include equity method, cost method, and available-for-sale equity investments. Available-for-sale\ninvestments are recorded at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses relating to investments classified as available-for-sale are recorded as a\ncomponent of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders’ equity.\n \nOther assets: Other assets include deferred income taxes, product and other insurance receivables, the cash surrender value of life insurance\npolicies, and other long-term assets. Investments in life insurance are reported at the amount that could be realized under contract at the\nbalance sheet date, with any changes in cash surrender value or contract value during the period accounted for as an adjustment of premiums\npaid. Cash outflows and inflows associated with life\n56\n \nTable of Contents \ninsurance activity are included in “Purchases of marketable securities and investments” and “Proceeds from maturities and sale of\nmarketable securities and investments,” respectively.\n \nInventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost generally determined on a first-in, first-out basis.\n \nProperty, plant and equipment: Property, plant and equipment, including capitalized interest and internal engineering costs, are recorded at\ncost. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment generally is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives\nof the assets. The estimated useful lives of buildings and improvements primarily range from ten to forty years, with the majority in the\nrange of twenty to forty years. The estimated useful lives of machinery and equipment primarily range from three to fifteen years, with the\nmajority in the range of five to ten years. Fully depreciated assets are retained in property and accumulated depreciation accounts until\ndisposal. Upon disposal, assets and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the net amount, less proceeds from\ndisposal, is charged or credited to operations. Property, plant and equipment amounts are reviewed for impairment whenever events or\nchanges in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be\nrecognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the\nasset and its eventual disposition. The amount of the impairment loss recorded is calculated by the excess of the asset’s carrying value over\nits fair value. Fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis.\n \nConditional asset retirement obligations: A liability is initially recorded at fair value for an asset retirement obligation associated with the\nretirement of tangible long-lived assets in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. Conditional\nasset retirement obligations exist for certain long-term assets of the Company. The obligation is initially measured at fair value using\nexpected present value techniques. Over time the liabilities are accreted for the change in their present value and the initial capitalized costs\nare depreciated over the remaining useful lives of the related assets. The asset retirement obligation liability was $102 million and $96\nmillion at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\n \nGoodwill: Goodwill is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a\nbusiness combination. Goodwill is not amortized. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year, and is tested\nfor impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired.\nImpairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level, with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. Reporting units are one level\nbelow the business segment level, but can be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic\ncharacteristics. 3M did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing. An impairment loss generally would be recognized\nwhen the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. The estimated fair value of\na reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a price/earnings ratio for comparable industry groups, or by\nusing a discounted cash flow analysis. Companies have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of a\nreporting unit is not “more likely than not” less than its carrying amount, which is commonly referred to as “Step 0”. 3M has chosen not to\napply Step 0 for 2015 or prior period annual goodwill assessments.\n \nIntangible assets: Intangible asset types include customer related, patents, other technology-based, tradenames and other intangible assets\nacquired from an independent party. Intangible assets with a definite life are amortized over a period ranging from one to twenty years on a\nsystematic and rational basis (generally straight line) that is representative of the asset’s use. The estimated useful lives vary by category,\nwith customer related largely between seven to seventeen years, patents largely between five to thirteen years, other technology-based\nlargely between two to fifteen years, definite lived tradenames largely between three and twenty years, and other intangibles largely\nbetween two to ten years. Costs related to internally developed intangible assets, such as patents, are expensed as incurred, primarily in\n“Research, development and related expenses.”\n \nIntangible assets with a definite life are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an\nasset (asset group) may not be recoverable.

Unfortunately, we cannot calculate the \'Total revenue\' or \'Net sales\' for 2014 using this information.\n\nHowever, we can see that the \'New Accounting Pronouncements:\' section mentions that the Company has adopted new accounting', '```python\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\n\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n  explanation: str\n  citation: str | None\n  answer: str | None\n\njob_output = JobOutput(\n  explanation="The required information is not found in the provided excerpt.

However, we can infer that the company\'s financial statements are not directly provided.\n\nIf we look at the excerpt, we can see that the company adopted ASU 2015-03 in the fourth quarter of 2015 with retrospective application to prior periods. As a result, debt issue costs aggregating $26 million previously included within Other Assets have been reflected as reductions in the balances of Long-Term Debt as of December 31, 2014.\n\nThis information is related to the debt issuance costs, not the total revenue or net sales. However, we can see that the company reclassified $169 million of remaining other current tax assets to prepaid expenses and other to conform to the 2015 presentation in conjunction with the adoption of ASU 2015-16.\n\nSince the required information is not found in the provided excerpt, I will set the answer to None.\n\n```python\njob_output = JobOutput(\n  explanation="The required information is not found in the provided excerpt.",\n  citation=None,\n  answer=None\n)\n\nprint(job_output)\n```', '```python\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\n\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n  explanation: str\n  citation: str | None\n  answer: str | None\n\njob_output = JobOutput(\n  explanation="The exact figure for \'Total Revenue\' or \'Net Sales\' for the year 2014 is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text.

The text does not explicitly mention the \'Total Revenue\' or \'Net Sales\' for the year 2014. But it does mention that the impact of other matters (net) during 2014 aggregated to $94 million. This might be related to revenue, but it\'s not clear.\n\nIf we look at the acquisitions section, we can see that the purchase price paid for the business combination in 2014 aggregated to $94 million.

Research, development and related expenses totaled $1.763 billion in 2015, $1.770 billion in 2014 and $1.715 billion in 2013.\nResearch and development, covering basic scientific research and the application of scientific advances in the development of new and\nimproved products and their uses, totaled $1.223 billion in 2015, $1.193 billion in 2014 and $1.150 billion in 2013. Related expenses\nprimarily include technical support; internally developed patent costs, which include costs and fees incurred to prepare, file, secure and\nmaintain patents; amortization of externally acquired patents and externally acquired in-process research and development; and gains/losses\nassociated with certain corporate approved investments in R&D-related ventures, such as equity method effects and impairments.\n \nThe Company’s products are sold around the world under various trademarks. The Company also owns, or holds licenses to use, numerous\nU.S. and foreign patents. The Company’s research and development activities generate a steady stream of inventions that are covered by\nnew patents. Patents applicable to specific products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or patent\ngrant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent,\nwhich can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in\nthe country.\n \nThe Company believes that its patents provide an important competitive advantage in many of its businesses. In general, no single patent or\ngroup of related patents is in itself essential to the Company as a whole or to any of the Company’s business segments. The importance of\npatents in the Electronics and Energy segment is described in “Performance by Business Segment” — “Electronics and Energy Business” in\nPart II, Item 7, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n \nRaw Materials\n \nIn 2015, the Company experienced declining costs for most raw material categories and transportation fuel, due largely to the significant\nprice decreases in crude oil. This in turn drove year-on-year cost decreases in many feedstock categories, including petroleum based\nmaterials, minerals, metals and wood pulp based products. To date, the Company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to\nmeet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements. It is impossible to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such\nshortages would have. 3M has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of existing raw material\ninventories and development and qualification of additional supply sources. 3M manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply\ncontracts, price protection agreements and forward contracts.\n \nEnvironmental Law Compliance\n \n3M’s manufacturing operations are affected by national, state and local environmental laws around the world. 3M has made, and plans to\ncontinue making, necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable laws. 3M is also involved in remediation actions relating to\nenvironmental matters from past operations at certain sites (refer to “Environmental Matters and Litigation” in Note 14, Commitments and\nContingencies).\n \nEnvironmental expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are\nexpensed. Reserves for liabilities for anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and\nreasonably estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies, the Company’s commitment to a plan of action, or\napproval by regulatory agencies. Environmental expenditures for capital\n6\n \nTable of Contents \nprojects that contribute to current or future operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.\n \nIn 2015, 3M expended about $26 million for capital projects related to protecting the environment. This amount excludes expenditures for\nremediation actions relating to existing matters caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues, which are\nexpensed. Capital expenditures for environmental purposes have included pollution control devices — such as wastewater treatment plant\nimprovements, scrubbers, containment structures, solvent recovery units and thermal oxidizers — at new and existing facilities constructed\nor upgraded in the normal course of business. Consistent with the Company’s emphasis on environmental responsibility, capital\nexpenditures (other than for remediation projects) for known projects are presently expected to be about $51 million over the next two years\nfor new or expanded programs to build facilities or modify manufacturing processes to minimize waste and reduce emissions.\n \nWhile the Company cannot predict with certainty the future costs of such cleanup activities, capital expenditures or operating costs for\nenvironmental compliance, the Company does not believe they will have a material effect on its capital expenditures, earnings or\ncompetitive position.\n \nExecutive Officers\n \nFollowing is a list of the executive officers of 3M, and their age, present position, the year elected to their present position and other\npositions they have held during the past five years. No family relationships exist among any of the executive officers named, nor is there\nany undisclosed arrangement or understanding pursuant to which any person was selected as an officer.

The Company may\nalso make forward-looking statements in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in materials delivered to\nshareholders and in press releases. In addition, the Company’s representatives may from time to time make oral forward-looking statements.\n \nForward-looking statements relate to future events and typically address the Company’s expected future business and financial performance.\nWords such as “plan,” “expect,” “aim,” “believe,” “project,” “target,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “estimate,” “will,” “should,” “could,”\n“forecast”  and other words and terms of similar meaning, typically identify such forward-looking statements. In particular, these include,\namong others, statements relating to:\n·\nthe Company’s strategy for growth, future revenues, earnings, cash flow, uses of cash and other measures of financial\nperformance, and market position,\n·\nworldwide economic and capital markets conditions, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, financial conditions\nof our suppliers and customers, and natural and other disasters or climate change affecting the operations of the Company or our\nsuppliers and customers,\n·\nnew business opportunities, product development, and future performance or results of current or anticipated products,\n·\nthe scope, nature or impact of acquisition, strategic alliance and divestiture activities,\n·\nthe outcome of contingencies, such as legal and regulatory proceedings,\n·\nfuture levels of indebtedness, common stock repurchases and capital spending,\n·\nfuture availability of and access to credit markets,\n·\npension and postretirement obligation assumptions and future contributions,\n·\nasset impairments,\n·\ntax liabilities,\n·\ninformation technology security, and\n·\nthe effects of changes in tax, environmental and other laws and regulations in the United States and other countries in which we\noperate.\n \nThe Company assumes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements.\n \nForward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events and trends that are subject to risks and\nuncertainties. Actual future results and trends may differ materially from historical results or those reflected in any such forward-looking\nstatements depending on a variety of factors. Important information as to these factors can be found in this document, including, among\nothers, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” under the headings of “Overview,”\n“Financial Condition and Liquidity” and annually in “Critical Accounting Estimates.”  Discussion of these factors is incorporated by\nreference from Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of this document, and should be considered an integral part of Part II, Item 7,\n“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” For additional information concerning factors\nthat may cause actual results to vary materially from those stated in the forward-looking statements, see our reports on Form 10-K, 10-Q\nand 8-K filed with the SEC from time to time.\n \nItem 1A. Risk Factor s.\n \nProvided below is a cautionary discussion of what we believe to be the most important risk factors applicable to the Company. Discussion\nof these factors is incorporated by reference into and considered an integral part of Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nof Financial Conditions and Results of Operations.”\n \n* Results are impacted by the effects of, and changes in, worldwide economic, political, and capital markets conditions. The Company\noperates in more than 70 countries and derives approximately 60 percent of its revenues from outside the United States. The Company’s\nbusiness is subject to global competition and geopolitical risks and may be adversely affected by factors in the United States and other\ncountries that are beyond its control, such as slower economic growth, disruptions in financial markets, economic downturns in the form of\neither contained or widespread recessionary\n9\n \nTable of Contents \nconditions, inflation, elevated unemployment levels, sluggish or uneven recovery, government deficit reduction and other austerity measures\nin specific countries or regions, or in the various industries in which the Company operates; social, political or labor conditions in specific\ncountries or regions; natural and other disasters or climate change affecting the operations of the Company or its customers and suppliers; or\nadverse changes in the availability and cost of capital, interest rates, tax rates, tax laws, or exchange control, ability to expatriate earnings\nand other regulations in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates.\n \n* Change in the Company’s credit ratings could increase cost of funding. The Company’s credit ratings are important to 3M’s cost of\ncapital. The major rating agencies routinely evaluate the Company’s credit profile and assign debt ratings to 3M. The Company has an AA-\ncredit rating, with a stable outlook, from Standard & Poor’s and an Aa3 credit rating, with a negative outlook, from Moody’s Investors\nService. This evaluation is based on a number of factors, which include financial strength, business and financial risk, as well as\ntransparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting. The Company’s credit ratings have served to lower 3M’s borrowing\ncosts and facilitate access to a variety of lenders. The Company’s ongoing transition to a more optimized capital structure, financed with\nadditional low-cost debt, could impact 3M’s credit rating in the future. Failure to maintain strong investment grade ratings would adversely\naffect the Company’s cost of funding and could adversely affect liquidity and access to capital markets.\n \n* The Company’s results are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences. Demand for the Company’s products, which\nimpacts revenue and profit margins, is affected by (i) the development and timing of the introduction of competitive products; (ii) the\nCompany’s response to downward pricing to stay competitive; (iii) changes in customer order patterns, such as changes in the levels of\ninventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases which may be affected by announced price changes, changes in\nthe Company’s incentive programs, or the customer’s ability to achieve incentive goals; and (iv) changes in customers’ preferences for our\nproducts, including the success of products offered by our competitors, and changes in customer designs for their products that can affect the\ndemand for some of the Company’s products.\n \n* Foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the Company’s ability to realize projected growth rates in its\nsales and earnings. Because the Company’s financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars and approximately 60 percent of the\nCompany’s revenues are derived from outside the United States, the Company’s results of operations and its ability to realize projected\ngrowth rates in sales and earnings could be adversely affected if the U.S. dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies.\n \n* The Company’s growth objectives are largely dependent on the timing and market acceptance of its new product offerings, including its\nability to continually renew its pipeline of new products and to bring those products to market. This ability may be adversely affected by\ndifficulties or delays in product development, such as the inability to identify viable new products, obtain adequate intellectual property\nprotection, or gain market acceptance of new products. There are no guarantees that new products will prove to be commercially successful.\n \n* The Company’s future results are subject to fluctuations in the costs and availability of purchased components, compounds, raw materials\nand energy, including oil and natural gas and their derivatives, due to shortages, increased demand, supply interruptions, currency\nexchange risks, natural disasters and other factors. The Company depends on various components, compounds, raw materials, and energy\n(including oil and natural gas and their derivatives) supplied by others for the manufacturing of its products. It is possible that any of its\nsupplier relationships could be interrupted due to natural and other disasters and other events, or be terminated in the future. Any sustained\ninterruption in the Company’s receipt of adequate supplies could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, while the\nCompany has a process to minimize volatility in component and material pricing, no assurance can be given that the Company will be able\nto successfully manage price fluctuations or that future price fluctuations or shortages will not have a material adverse effect on the\nCompany.\n \n* Acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures, and other unusual events resulting from portfolio management actions and other evolving\nb\n\n--------------------------------\nAnd here is your task:\n\nExtract the exact total revenue (or net sales) figure for 2014 in billions of dollars.

The Company monitors its business portfolio and\norganizational structure and has made and may continue to make acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures and changes to its\norganizational structure. With respect to acquisitions,\n10\n \nTable of Contents \nfuture results will be affected by the Company’s ability to integrate acquired businesses quickly and obtain the anticipated synergies.\n \n* The Company’s future results may be affected if the Company generates fewer productivity improvements than estimated. The Company\nutilizes various tools, such as Lean Six Sigma, and engages in ongoing global business transformation. Business transformation is defined\nas changes in processes and internal/external service delivery across 3M to move to more efficient business models to improve operational\nefficiency and productivity, while allowing 3M to serve customers with greater speed and efficiency. This is enabled by the ongoing multi-\nyear phased implementation of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system on a worldwide basis. There can be no assurance that all of the\nprojected productivity improvements will be realized.\n \n* The Company employs information technology systems to support its business, including ongoing phased implementation of an ERP\nsystem as part of business transformation on a worldwide basis over the next several years. Security breaches and other disruptions to the\nCompany’s information technology infrastructure could interfere with the Company’s operations, compromise information belonging to the\nCompany and its customers,  suppliers, and employees, exposing the Company to liability which could adversely impact the Company’s\nbusiness and reputation. In the ordinary course of business, the Company relies on information technology networks and systems, some of\nwhich are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business\nprocesses and activities. Additionally, the Company collects and stores certain data, including proprietary business information, and may\nhave access to confidential or personal information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and\ncustomer-imposed controls. Despite our cybersecurity measures (including employee and third-party training, monitoring of networks and\nsystems, and maintenance of backup and protective systems) which are continuously reviewed and upgraded, the Company’s information\ntechnology networks and infrastructure may still be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attack by hackers or breaches,\nemployee error or malfeasance, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures, service providers\nincluding cloud services, natural disasters or other catastrophic events. It is possible for such vulnerabilities to remain undetected for an\nextended period, up to and including several years. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of threats\nto the Company’s information technology networks and infrastructure, none of them to date has had a material impact to the Company.\nThere may be other challenges and risks as the Company upgrades and standardizes its ERP system on a worldwide basis. Any such events\ncould result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or penalties under privacy laws, disruption in operations, and damage to the Company’s\nreputation, which could adversely affect the Company’s business. Although the Company maintains insurance coverage for various\ncybersecurity risks, there can be no guarantee that all costs or losses incurred will be fully insured.\n \n* The Company\'s defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely impact our\nresults. The performance of financial markets and discount rates impact the Company\'s funding obligations under its defined benefit plans.\nSignificant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets, and relevant\nlegislative or regulatory changes relating to defined benefit plan funding may increase the Company\'s funding obligations and adversely\nimpact its results of operations and cash flows.\n \n* The Company’s future results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings and legal compliance risks, including those\ninvolving product liability, antitrust, intellectual property, environmental, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery,\nanti-corruption, or other matters. The outcome of these legal proceedings may differ from the Company’s expectations because the\noutcomes of litigation, including regulatory matters, are often difficult to reliably predict. Various factors or developments can lead the\nCompany to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable, or make such estimates for matters\npreviously not susceptible of reasonable estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment, a significant settlement, significant\nregulatory developments or changes in applicable law. A future adverse ruling, settlement or unfavorable development could result in future\ncharges that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations or cash flows in any particular period.

As described in Note\n16,  effective in the third quarter of 2015, within the Health Care business segment, the Company formed the Oral Care Solutions Division,\nwhich combined the former 3M ESPE and 3M Unitek divisions. 3M manages its operations in five operating business segments: Industrial;\nSafety and Graphics; Health Care; Electronics and Energy; and Consumer. From a geographic perspective, any references to EMEA refer to\nEurope, Middle East and Africa on a combined basis.\n \nRestructuring actions:\n \nDuring the fourth quarter of 2015, management approved and committed to undertake certain restructuring actions primarily focused on\nstructural overhead, largely in the U.S., and slower-growing markets, with particular emphasis on EMEA and Latin America. This impacted\napproximately 1,700 positions worldwide and resulted in a fourth-quarter 2015 pre-tax charge of $114 million, $88 million after-tax or\n$0.14 per diluted share.\n \nEarnings per share attributable to 3M common shareholders – diluted:\n \nThe following table provides the increase (decrease) in diluted earnings per share for 2015 compared to 2014, and 2014 compared to 2013.\n \n    \nYear ended \n \n \n \nDecember 31,\n \n(Earnings per diluted share)\n    \n2015\n \n2014\n \nSame period last year\n \n$\n7.49  $\n6.72  \nIncrease/(decrease) in earnings per share - diluted, due to:\n \n  \n   \n \nOperational benefits\n \n \n0.40   \n0.66  \nRestructuring charges\n \n \n(0.14)  \n —  \nAcquisitions and divestitures\n \n \n(0.02)  \n —  \nForeign exchange impacts\n \n \n(0.43)  \n(0.15) \nIncome tax rate\n \n \n —   \n(0.08) \nShares of common stock outstanding\n \n \n0.28   \n0.34  \nCurrent period\n \n$\n7.58  $\n7.49  \n16\n \nTable of Contents \nFor total year 2015, net income attributable to 3M was $4.833 billion, or $7.58 per diluted share, compared to $4.956 billion, or $7.49 per\ndiluted share, in 2014, an increase of 1.2 percent on a per diluted share basis. Operational benefits include the combination of selling price\nincreases and raw material cost decreases, partially offset by higher pension/postretirement benefit costs. Restructuring actions (discussed\nabove) resulted in an after-tax charge of 14 cents per diluted share. Acquisition and divestiture impacts primarily relate to the Capital Safety\nand Polypore Separations Media acquisitions, and the divestitures of the license plate converting business in France and substantially all of\nthe library systems business. Foreign exchange impacts decreased earnings per diluted share by approximately 43 cents year-on-year, driven\nby average year-on-year changes in foreign exchange rates in the Euro of 17 percent, Yen of 12 percent, and Brazil Real of 30 percent. The\nincome tax rate was largely unchanged year-on-year. Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding in 2015 declined 3.7 percent year-on-year\nto 637.2 million, which increased earnings per diluted share by approximately 28 cents. Refer to the section entitled “Results of Operations”\nfor further discussion.\n \nFor total year 2014, net income attributable to 3M was $4.956 billion, or $7.49 per diluted share, compared to $4.659 billion, or $6.72 per\ndiluted share, in 2013, an increase of 11.5 percent on a per diluted share basis. Operational benefits include a significant benefit from the\ncombination of selling price increases and raw material cost decreases, plus profit leverage on organic volume growth. Foreign exchange\nimpacts decreased earnings per diluted share by approximately 15 cents per diluted share. The income tax rate was 28.9 percent in 2014, up\n0.8 percentage points versus 2013, which decreased earnings per diluted share by approximately 8 cents. Weighted-average diluted shares\noutstanding in 2014 declined 4.6 percent year-on-year to 662.0 million, which increased earnings per diluted share by approximately 34\ncents.\n \nFourth-quarter 2015 sales and operating income results: \n \nFourth-quarter 2015 net income attributable to 3M was $1.038 billion, or $1.66 per diluted share, compared to $1.179 billion, or $1.81 per\ndiluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2014. Fourth-quarter 2015 sales totaled $7.3 billion, a decrease of 5.4 percent from the fourth quarter\nof 2014. 3M achieved organic local-currency sales growth (which includes organic volume and selling price impacts) in Health Care, and\nConsumer, with declines in Industrial, Safety and Graphics, and Electronics and Energy. Organic local-currency sales increased 4.5 percent\nin Health Care, led by health information systems, food safety, oral care, drug delivery systems, and critical and chronic care. Organic local-\ncurrency sales increased 2.7 percent in the Consumer business segment, with positive growth in the construction and home improvement\nbusiness, stationery and office supplies, and home care, while consumer health care declined. Organic local-currency sales declined 1.8\npercent in Industrial, with sales growth in 3M purification and automotive OEM more than offset by declines in industrial adhesives and\ntapes, abrasives, and advanced materials. Organic local-currency sales declined 2.5 percent in Safety and Graphics, with sales declines in\npersonal safety partially offset by sales growth in roofing granules, and commercial solutions, while traffic safety and security was flat.\nElectronics and Energy organic local-currency sales growth declined 7.7 percent, with decreases in electronic-related sales in both\nelectronics materials solutions, and display materials and systems. Energy-related organic local-currency sales declined in renewable energy,\ncommunications markets, and electrical markets.

Organic local-currency\nsales declined 0.4 percent in the United States, 0.6 percent in Latin America/Canada, and 2.7 percent in Asia Pacific. In EMEA, Central/East\nEurope showed solid local-currency sales growth in the quarter, while West Europe was up slightly, and Middle East/Africa declined.\nOrganic local-currency sales in the United States declined, as 3M experienced weak end-market demand in its industrial-related businesses.\nThe consumer-oriented businesses (Health Care and Consumer) continued to deliver positive organic growth.

From a business segment perspective, organic local-currency sales\nincreased 3.7 percent in Health Care, 3.4 percent in Consumer, 2.4 percent in Safety and Graphics, and 0.7 percent in Industrial, while sales\ndeclined 1.9 percent in Electronics and Energy. From a geographic area perspective, 2015 organic local-currency sales grew 2.1 percent in\nthe United States, 1.5 percent in Latin America/Canada, 0.9 percent in Asia Pacific, and 0.8 percent in EMEA. For the Company in total,\norganic local-currency sales grew 1.3 percent, with higher organic volumes contributing 0.2 percent and selling price increases contributing\n1.1 percent.

This new program has no pre-established\nend date. In 2015,  2014, and 2013, the Company purchased more than $5 billion of its own stock each year.

In February 2016, 3M’s Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2016 dividend\nof $1.11 per share, an increase of 8 percent. This marked the 58th consecutive year of dividend increases for 3M. 3M’s debt to total capital\nratio (total capital defined as debt plus equity) was 48 percent at December 31, 2015,  34 percent at December 31, 2014, and 25 percent at\nDecember 31, 2013.

This in turn drove year-on-year cost decreases in many feedstock categories, including petroleum based\nmaterials, minerals, metals and wood pulp based products. To date the Company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to\nmeet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements. It is impossible to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such\nshortages would have. 3M has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of existing raw material\ninventories and development and qualification of additional supply sources. 3M manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply\ncontracts, price protection agreements and forward contracts.\n \nPension and postretirement defined benefit/contribution plans:\n \nOn a worldwide basis, 3M’s pension and postretirement plans were 86 percent funded at year-end 2015. The primary U.S. qualified pension\nplan, which is approximately 69 percent of the worldwide pension obligation, was 91 percent funded and the international pension plans\nwere 90 percent funded. The U.S. non-qualified pension plan is not funded due to tax considerations and other factors. Asset returns in 2015\nfor the primary U.S. qualified pension plan was 0.7%, as 3M strategically invests in both growth assets and fixed income matching assets to\nmanage its funded status. For the primary U.S. qualified pension plan, the expected long-term rate of return on an annualized basis for 2016\nis 7.50%, down 0.25% from 2015. The primary U.S. qualified pension plan year-end 2015 discount rate was 4.47%, up 0.37 percentage\npoints from the year-end 2014 discount rate of 4.10%. The increase in U.S. discount rates resulted in a decreased valuation of the projected\nbenefit obligation (PBO), however the plan’s funded status decreased slightly in 2015 as the growth in the PBO increased at a greater rate\nthan the plan assets returned in 2015. Additional detail and discussion of international plan asset returns and discount rates is provided in\nNote 11 (Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans).\n \n3M expects to contribute approximately $100 million to $200 million of cash to its global defined benefit pension and postretirement plans\nin 2016. The Company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2016. 3M expects\nglobal defined benefit pension and postretirement expense in 2016 (before settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other)\nto decrease by approximately $320 million pre-tax when compared to 2015. Refer to “Critical Accounting Estimates” within MD&A and\nNote 11 (Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans) for additional information concerning 3M’s pension and post-retirement plans.\n \nBeginning on January 1, 2016, with respect to defined contribution plans, the Company reduced its match on employee 401(k) contributions\nfor U.S. employees. Previously, based on the date the employee was hired, up to 6% of eligible compensation was matched in cash at rates\nof 60%, 75% or 100%. Beginning in 2016, 5% of eligible compensation will be matched at rates of 45%, 60% or 100%, respectively. The\nreduction in the company’s match is anticipated to reduce 2016 defined contribution pension expense by approximately $35 million.\n \n20\n \nTable of Contents \nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n \nNet Sales:\n \n \n \n2015\n \n2014\n \n \n    \nU.S.\n    \nIntl.\n    \nWorldwide     \nU.S.\n    \nIntl.\n    \nWorldwide  \nNet sales (millions)\n $\n12,049  \n$\n18,225  \n$\n30,274  \n$\n11,714  \n$\n20,107  \n$\n31,821  \n% of worldwide sales\n  \n39.8 %   \n60.2 %   \n  \n \n36.8 %   \n63.2 %   \n  \nComponents of net sales change:\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nVolume — organic\n  \n1.7 %   \n(0.5)%   \n0.2 %   \n4.4 %   \n3.8 %   \n3.9 %\nPrice\n  \n0.4  \n \n1.4  \n \n1.1  \n \n0.5  \n \n1.2  \n \n1.0  \nOrganic local-currency sales\n  \n2.1  \n \n0.9  \n \n1.3  \n \n4.9  \n \n5.0  \n \n4.9  \nAcquisitions\n  \n1.2  \n \n0.5  \n \n0.8  \n \n0.2  \n \n —  \n \n0.1  \nDivestitures\n  \n(0.4) \n \n(0.1) \n \n(0.2) \n \n(0.1) \n \n—  \n \n—  \nTranslation\n  \n—  \n \n(10.7) \n \n(6.8) \n \n—  \n \n(3.0) \n \n(1.9) \nTotal sales change\n  \n2.9 %   \n(9.4)%   \n(4.9)%   \n5.0 %   \n2.0 %   \n3.1 %\n \nIn 2015, organic local-currency sales grew 1.3 percent, with increases of 2.1 percent in the United States, 1.5 percent in Latin\nAmerica/Canada, 0.9 percent in Asia Pacific, and 0.8 percent in EMEA.

Business transformation is defined as changes in processes and internal/external\nservice delivery across 3M to move to more efficient business models to improve operational efficiency and productivity, while allowing\n3M to serve customers with greater speed and efficiency. This is enabled by the ongoing multi-year phased implementation of an enterprise\nresource planning (ERP) system on a worldwide basis.\n \nIn the fourth quarter of 2015, as discussed within the Overview section above, 3M incurred restructuring charges impacting operating\nexpenses as follows:\n \n \n \n \n(Millions)\n    \n2015\n \nCost of sales\n \n \n40  \nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n \n \n62  \nResearch, development and related expenses\n \n \n12  \nTotal\n \n$\n114  \n \nCost of Sales:\n \nCost of sales includes manufacturing, engineering and freight costs.\n \nCost of sales, measured as a percent of net sales, was 50.9 percent in 2015, a decrease of 0.8 percentage points from 2014. Cost of sales as a\npercent of sales decreased due to the combination of selling price increases and raw material cost decreases, as selling prices increased net\nsales by 1.1 percent and raw material cost deflation was favorable by approximately 3.5 percent year-on-year. In addition, higher pension\nand postretirement costs (of which a portion impacts cost of sales) and fourth quarter 2015 restructuring charges, increased cost of sales as a\npercent of sales.\n \nCost of sales, measured as a percent of net sales, was 51.7 percent in 2014, a decrease of 0.4 percentage points from 2013. Cost of sales as a\npercent of sales decreased due to the combination of selling price increases and raw material cost decreases, as selling prices increased net\nsales by 1.0 percent and raw material cost deflation was favorable by approximately 1.5 percent year-on-year. In addition, lower pension and\npostretirement costs (of which a portion impacts cost of sales), along with organic volume leverage, decreased cost of sales as a percent of\nsales.\n \nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses:\n \nSelling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) decreased $287 million, or 4.4 percent, in 2015 when compared to 2014. The\ntranslation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars reduced SG&A expense, as evidenced by our foreign currency translation impact which\nreduced worldwide sales by 6.8 percent. This foreign currency translation benefit was partially offset by higher pension and postretirement\nexpense and fourth quarter 2015 restructuring charges. SG&A, measured as a percent of sales, increased 0.1 percentage points to 20.4\npercent in 2015, compared to 20.3 percent of sales in 2014.\n \nSelling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) increased $85 million, or 1.3 percent, in 2014 when compared to 2013.

R&D increased 3.2\npercent in 2014 compared to 2013. 3M continued to support its key growth initiatives, including more R&D aimed at disruptive innovation,\nwhich refers to innovation which has the potential to create new markets and disrupt existing markets. In 2015, like SG&A, R&D spending\nin U.S. dollars was reduced due to the translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars. These 2015 translation benefits were partially offset\nby higher pension and postretirement expense in 2015 when compared to 2014. In 2014, increases in R&D, when compared to 2013, were\npartially offset by lower pension and postretirement expense.

These results\nincluded a significant benefit from the combination of higher selling prices and lower raw material costs, and a benefit from productivity\nand other items. These benefits were partially offset by higher pension and postretirement benefit costs, 2015 restructuring charges, higher\nstrategic investments, and acquisition and divestiture impacts. Strategic investments include incremental programs around disruptive R&D\nand business transformation. Acquisition and divestiture impacts primarily relate to the Capital Safety and Polypore Separations Media\nacquisitions, and the divestitures of substantially all of the library systems business, along with the license plate converting business in\nFrance. \n \nOperating income margins were 22.4 percent in 2014 compared to 21.6 percent in 2013, an increase of 0.8 percentage points. These results\nincluded a significant benefit from the combination of higher selling prices and lower raw material costs. In addition, lower year-on-year\npension and postretirement benefit costs and profit leverage on organic volume growth provided benefits. Items that reduced operating\nincome margins included strategic investments, which included investments in disruptive R&D, business transformation, the supply chain\ncenter of expertise in Europe, and portfolio management actions. The Company invested $90 million in 2014 in portfolio management\nactions to position 3M for greater success. Foreign currency effects and acquisition impacts (Treo) reduced operating income margins.\n \nInterest Expense and Income:\n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n(Millions)\n    \n2015\n    \n2014\n    \n2013\n \nInterest expense\n $\n149  $\n142  $\n145  \nInterest income\n  \n(26)  \n(33)  \n(41) \nTotal\n $\n123  $\n109  $\n104  \n \nInterest Expense:  Interest expense increased slightly in 2015 compared to 2014, despite significantly higher debt levels, helped by lower\naverage interest rates. Interest expense decreased in 2014 compared to 2013, again despite higher debt levels, primarily due to lower U.S.\nborrowing costs as debt maturities were replaced with lower cost financing from commercial paper and lower interest rates on new debt\nissuances.\n \nCapitalized interest related to property, plant and equipment construction in progress is recorded as a reduction to interest expense. The\namounts shown in the table above for interest expense are net of capitalized interest amounts of $13 million, $15 million, and $21 million, in\n2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\n \n23\n \nTable of Contents \nInterest Income: Interest income in 2015 was lower when compared to 2014 due to lower average cash/marketable securities balances.\nInterest income in 2014 was lower when compared to 2013 due to lower cash balances.\n \nProvision for Income Taxes:\n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(Percent of pre-tax income)\n    \n2015\n    \n2014\n    \n2013\n \nEffective tax rate\n \n29.1 %  \n28.9 %  \n28.1 %\n \nThe effective tax rate for 2015 was 29.1 percent, compared to 28.9 percent in 2014, an increase of 0.2 percentage points.  The effective tax\nrate for 2014 was 28.9 percent, compared to 28.1 percent in 2013, an increase of 0.8 percentage points.  The changes in the rates between\nyears are impacted by many factors, as described further in Note 8.\n \nThe Company currently expects that its effective tax rate for 2016 will be approximately 29.5 to 30.5 percent. The rate can vary from\nquarter to quarter due to discrete items, such as the settlement of income tax audits and changes in tax laws, as well as recurring factors,\nsuch as the geographic mix of income before taxes.\n \nRefer to Note 8 for further discussion of income taxes.\n \nNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest:\n \n(Millions)\n    \n2015\n    \n2014\n    \n2013\n \nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interest\n $\n8  $\n42  $\n62  \n \nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interest represents the elimination of the income or loss attributable to non-3M ownership interests\nin 3M consolidated entities. The changes in noncontrolling interest amounts have largely related to Sumitomo 3M Limited (Japan), which\nwas 3M’s most significant consolidated entity with non-3M ownership interests. As discussed in Note 6, on September 1, 2014, 3M\npurchased the remaining 25 percent ownership in Sumitomo 3M Limited, bringing 3M’s ownership to 100 percent. Thus, effective\nSeptember 1, 2014, net income attributable to noncontrolling interest was significantly reduced. The primary remaining noncontrolling\ninterest relates to 3M India Limited, of which 3M’s effective ownership is 75 percent.\n \nCurrency Effects:\n \n3M estimates that year-on-year currency effects, including hedging impacts, decreased pre-tax income by approximately $390 million and\n$100 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. These estimates include the effect of translating profits from local currencies into U.S. dollars;\nthe impact of currency fluctuations on the transfer of goods between 3M operations in the United States and abroad; and transaction gains\nand losses, including derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks and the negative impact of swapping\nVenezuelan bolivars into U.S. dollars. 3M estimates that year-on-year derivative and other transaction gains and losses increased pre-tax\nincome by approximately $180 million and $10 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Refer to Note 12 in the Consolidated Financial\nStatements for additional information concerning 3M’s hedging activities. \n \nPERFORMANCE BY BUSINESS SEGMENT\n \nDisclosures relating to 3M’s business segments are provided in Item 1, Business Segments. Financial information and other disclosures are\nprovided in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  As described in Note 16, effective in the third quarter of 2015, within the\nHealth Care business segment, the Company formed the Oral Care Solutions Division, which combined the former 3M ESPE and 3M\nUnitek divisions. 3M manages its operations in five business segments. The reportable segments are Industrial; Safety and Graphics;\nElectronics and Energy; Health Care; and Consumer.\n \n24\n \nTable of Contents \nCorporate and Unallocated:\n \nIn addition to these five business segments, 3M assigns certain costs to “Corporate and Unallocated,” which is presented separately in the\npreceding business segments table and in Note 16. Corporate and Unallocated includes a variety of miscellaneous items, such as corporate\ninvestment gains and losses, certain derivative gains and losses, certain insurance-related gains and losses, certain litigation and\nenvironmental expenses, corporate restructuring charges and certain under- or over-absorbed costs (e.g. pension, stock-based compensation)\nthat the Company determines not to allocate directly to its business segments. Because this category includes a variety of miscellaneous\nitems, it is subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis.\n \nCorporate and Unallocated operating expenses increased by $104 million in 2015 when compared to 2014. This increase was driven by\nhigher pension and postretirement benefit expenses, which increased in total by $165 million. Of this increase, $153 million was allocated to\nCorporate and Unallocated. Increases were also driven by fourth quarter 2015 restructuring charges of $37 million, as indicated in the below\ntable. Items which partially offset these increases within Corporate and Unallocated included higher administrative and R&D cost\nabsorption by the five business segments, resulting in less under-absorbed expense being allocated to Corporate.\n \nCorporate and Unallocated operating expenses decreased by $70 million in 2014 when compared to 2013. This decrease was driven by lower\npension and postretirement benefit expenses, which declined year-on-year by $162 million. Of this reduction, $116 million was allocated to\nCorporate and Unallocated. This was partially offset by higher Corporate and Unallocated expenses related to year-on-year increases in\nannual incentive plan expenses and legal accruals.\n \nRestructuring Pre-Tax Charge by Business Segment:\n \n\n--------------------------------\nAnd here is your task:\n\nExtract the exact total revenue (or net sales) figure for 2014 in billions of dollars.

A portion of the products or components sold by 3M’s operations to its customers are\nexported by these customers to different geographic areas. As customers move their operations from one geographic area to another, 3M’s\nresults will follow.

Capital spending is discussed in more detail later in MD&A in the section entitled “Cash Flows from Investing Activities.”\n \n \nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\n \nInformation regarding significant accounting policies is included in Note 1. As stated in Note 1, the preparation of financial statements\nrequires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and\nrelated disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions\nthat are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying\nvalues of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n \nThe Company believes its most critical accounting estimates relate to legal proceedings, the Company’s pension and postretirement\nobligations, asset impairments and income taxes. Senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of its critical\naccounting estimates with the Audit Committee of 3M’s Board of Directors.\n \nLegal Proceedings:\n \nThe categories of claims for which the Company has a probable and estimable liability, the amount of its liability accruals, and the estimates\nof its related insurance receivables are critical accounting estimates related to legal proceedings.

The primary U.S. defined-benefit pension plan was closed to new participants effective January 1, 2009. The Company accounts for\nits defined benefit pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans in accordance with Accounting Standard\nCodification (ASC) 715, Compensation — Retirement Benefits, in measuring plan assets and benefit obligations and in determining the\namount of net periodic benefit cost. ASC 715 requires employers to recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit\npension or postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and recognize changes in the funded status in the\nyear in which the changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a component of stockholders’ equity. While\nthe company believes the valuation methods used to determine the fair value of plan assets are appropriate and consistent with other market\nparticipants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a\ndifferent estimate of fair value at the reporting date. See Note 11 for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining\npension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses.\n \nPension benefits associated with these plans are generally based primarily on each participant’s years of service, compensation, and age at\nretirement or termination. The benefit obligation represents the present value of the benefits that employees are entitled to in the future for\nservices already rendered as of the measurement date. The Company measures the present value of these future benefits by projecting\nbenefit payment cash flows for each future period and discounting these cash flows back to the December 31 measurement date, using the\nyields of a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle\nprojected future benefits. Historically, the single aggregated discount rate used for each plan’s benefit obligation was also used for the\ncalculation of all net periodic benefit costs, including the measurement of the service and interest costs. Beginning in 2016, 3M changed the\nmethod used to estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs. The new\nmethod measures service cost and interest cost separately using the spot yield curve approach applied to each corresponding obligation.\nService costs are determined based on duration-specific spot rates applied to the service cost cash flows. The interest cost calculation is\ndetermined by applying duration-specific spot rates to the year-by-year projected benefit payments. The spot yield curve approach does not\naffect the measurement of the total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest costs offset in the actuarial gains and losses\nrecorded in other comprehensive income. The Company changed to the new method to provide a more precise measure of service and\ninterest costs by improving the correlation between the projected benefit cash flows and the discrete spot yield curve rates. The Company\naccounted for this change as a change in estimate prospectively beginning in the first quarter of 2016. As a result of the change to the spot\nyield curve approach, 2016 defined benefit pension and postretirement net periodic benefit cost is expected to decrease by $180 million.\nIncluding this $180 million, 3M expects global defined benefit pension and postretirement expense in 2016 (before settlements,\ncurtailments, special termination benefits and other) to decrease by approximately $320 million pre-tax when compared to 2015.\n \nUsing this methodology, the Company determined discount rates for its plans as follow:\n \n \nU.S. Qualified\nPension\n    \nInternational\nPension\n(weighted\naverage)\n    \nU.S.\nPostretirement\nMedical\n \nDecember 31, 2014 Liability and 2015 Net Periodic Benefit Cost:\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSingle discount rate\n \n4.10 %\n3.11 %\n4.07 %\nDecember 31, 2015 Liability:\n \n  \n  \n  \nBenefit obligation\n \n4.47 %\n3.12 %\n4.32 %\n2016 Net Periodic Benefit Cost Components:\n \n  \n  \n  \nService cost\n \n4.72 %\n2.84 %\n4.60 %\nInterest cost\n \n3.77 %\n2.72 %\n3.44 %\n \nAnother significant element in determining the Company’s pension expense in accordance with ASC 715 is the expected return on plan\nassets, which is based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes. For the primary U.S. qualified pension plan, the\nexpected long-term rate of return on an annualized basis for 2016 is 7.50%, 0.25% lower than 2015. Refer to Note 11 for information on\nhow the 2015 rate was determined. Return on assets assumptions for\n35\n \nTable of Contents \ninternational pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are calculated on a plan-by-plan basis using plan asset allocations and expected\nlong-term rate of return assumptions. The weighted average expected return for the international pension plan is 5.77% for 2016, compared\nto 5.90% for 2015.\n \nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recognized total consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement\nexpense (after settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other) of $556 million, up from $391 million in 2014. Defined\nbenefit pension and postretirement expense (before settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other) is anticipated to\ndecrease to approximately $236 million in 2016, a decrease of $320 million compared to 2015.\n \nThe table below summarizes the impact on 2016 pension expense for the U.S. and international pension plans of a 0.25 percentage point\nincrease/decrease in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumptions used to measure plan liabilities and\n2016 net periodic benefit cost.

This includes the recoverability of long-lived assets employed in the business, including assets of acquired businesses.\nThese estimates and assumptions are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant. For instance,\nexpected asset lives may be shortened or an impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the\nrelated asset group.\n \n3M goodwill totaled approximately $9.2 billion as of December 31, 2015. 3M’s annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in the\nfourth quarter of each year. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level, with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit.\nReporting units are one level below the business segment level, but can be combined when reporting units within the same segment have\nsimilar economic characteristics. At 3M, reporting units generally correspond to a division. 3M did not combine any of its reporting units\nfor impairment testing.\n \nAn impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the estimated fair\nvalue of the reporting unit. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a\nprice/earnings ratio for comparable industry groups, or by using a discounted cash flow analysis. 3M typically uses the price/earnings ratio\napproach for stable and growing businesses that have a long history and track record of generating positive operating income and cash\nflows. 3M uses the discounted cash flow approach for start-up, loss position and declining businesses, in addition to businesses where the\nprice/earnings ratio valuation method indicates additional review is warranted. 3M also uses discounted cash flow as an additional tool for\nbusinesses that may be growing at a slower rate than planned due to economic or other conditions.\n \nAs described in Note 16, effective in the third quarter of 2015, within the Health Care business segment, the Company formed the Oral Care\nSolutions Division, which combined the former 3M ESPE and 3M Unitek divisions. For any product moves that resulted in reporting unit\nchanges, the Company applied the relative fair value method to determine the impact on goodwill of the associated reporting units. During\nthe third quarter of 2015, the Company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting units impacted by this\nnew structure and determined that no impairment existed. The discussion that follows relates to the separate fourth quarter 2015 annual\nimpairment test and is in the context of the reporting unit structure that existed at that time.\n \nAs of October 1, 2015, 3M had 26 primary reporting units, with ten reporting units accounting for approximately 87 percent of the goodwill.\nThese ten reporting units were comprised of the following divisions: 3M purification (which\n36\n \nTable of Contents \nincludes the Polypore Separations Media acquisition), Advanced Materials, Communication Markets, Display Materials and Systems,\nHealth Information Systems, Industrial Adhesives and Tape\n\n--------------------------------\nAnd here is your task:\n\nExtract the exact total revenue (or net sales) figure for 2014 in billions of dollars.

The estimated fair values for these reporting units were in excess of carrying\nvalue by approximately 50 percent or more, except for one reporting unit with approximately $300 million of goodwill, where the fair value\nexceeded the carrying value by approximately 30 percent. 3M’s market value at both September 30, 2015, and December 31, 2015, was\nsignificantly in excess of its equity of approximately $12 billion at both December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015.\n \nIn 2015, 3M primarily used an industry price-earnings ratio approach, but also used a discounted cash flows approach for certain reporting\nunits, to determine fair values. Where applicable, 3M used a weighted-average discounted cash flow analysis for certain divisions, using\nprojected cash flows that were weighted based on different sales growth and terminal value assumptions, among other factors. The\nweighting was based on management’s estimates of the likelihood of each scenario occurring.\n \n3M is an integrated materials enterprise, thus many of 3M’s businesses could not easily be sold on a stand-alone basis. 3M’s focus on\nresearch and development has resulted in a portion of 3M’s value being comprised of internally developed businesses that have no goodwill\nassociated with them. Based on the annual test in the fourth quarter of 2015, no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting\nunits.\n \nFactors which could result in future impairment charges include, among others, changes in worldwide economic conditions, changes in\ncompetitive conditions and customer preferences, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. These risk factors are discussed in\nItem 1A, “Risk Factors,” of this document. In addition, changes in the weighted average cost of capital could also impact impairment testing\nresults. As indicated above, during the third quarter of 2015, the Company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment\nfor reporting units impacted by changes between reporting units and determined that no impairment existed. Long-lived assets with a\ndefinite life are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset\ngroup) may not be recoverable. If future non-cash asset impairment charges are taken, 3M would expect that only a portion of the long-lived\nassets or goodwill would be impaired. 3M will continue to monitor its reporting units and asset groups in 2016 for any triggering events or\nother indicators of impairment.\n \nIncome Taxes:\n \nThe extent of 3M’s operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude\nof jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions\nand resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. The Company recognizes potential liabilities and records\ntax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether, and the extent\nto which, additional taxes will be due. The Company follows guidance provided by ASC 740, Income Taxes, regarding uncertainty in\nincome taxes, to record these liabilities (refer to Note 8 for additional information). The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing\nfacts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that\nis materially different from the Company’s current estimate of the tax liabilities. If the Company’s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be\nless than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less\nthan the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the Company\ndetermines the liabilities are no longer necessary.\n \nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\n \nInformation regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n \n37\n \nTable of Contents \nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY\n \n3M continues its transition to a better-optimized capital structure and is adding leverage at a measured pace. The strength and stability of\n3M\'s business model and strong free cash flow capability, together with proven capital markets access, enable the Company to implement\nthis strategy. Investing in 3M’s businesses to drive organic growth remains the first priority, thus 3M will continue to deploy capital towards\nresearch and development, capital expenditures, and commercialization capability. Investment in organic growth will be supplemented by\ncomplementary acquisitions. 3M will also continue to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Sources for cash\navailability in the United States, such as ongoing cash flow from operations and access to capital markets, have historically been sufficient\nto fund dividend payments to shareholders and share repurchases, as well as funding U.S. acquisitions and other items as needed. For those\ninternational earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely, the Company currently has no plans or intentions to repatriate these funds for\nU.S. operations. However, if these international funds are needed for operations in the U.S., 3M would be required to accrue and pay U.S.\ntaxes to repatriate them. See Note 8 for further information on earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely.\n \n3M’s primary short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand and U.S. commercial paper issuances. The Company believes it will\nhave continuous access to the commercial paper market. 3M’s commercial paper program permits the Company to have a maximum of $3\nbillion outstanding with a maximum maturity of 397 days from date of issuance.\n \nNet Debt:\n \nThe Company defines net debt as total debt less the total of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. 3M considers net debt and its\ncomponents to be an important indicator of liquidity and a guiding measure of capital structure strategy. Net debt is not defined under U.S.\ngenerally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. The\nfollowing table provides net debt as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.\n \nAt December 31\n        \n \n        \n \n \n(Millions)\n \n2015\n \n2014\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \nTotal Debt\n $\n10,797  $\n6,811  \nLess: Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities\n \n \n1,925  \n \n3,351  \nNet Debt\n $\n8,872  $\n3,460  \n \nIn 2015, net debt rose by $5.4 billion to a net debt balance of $8.9 billion (as of December 31, 2015), as 3M progressed on its capital\nstructure strategy. Debt levels were higher in both the U.S. and internationally, while international cash and marketable securities balances\nwere reduced. Specific actions related to cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, in addition to debt, are discussed further below.\n \nCash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities:\n \nAt December 31, 2015, 3M had $1.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which approximately $1.7 billion was\nheld by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries and $200 million was held by the United States. Of the $1.7 billion held internationally, U.S.\ndollar-based cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $355 million, or 21 percent, which was invested in money market\nfunds, asset-backed securities, agency securities, corporate medium-term note securities and other high quality fixed income securities. At\nDecember 31, 2014, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries and in the United States\ntotaled approximately $3.3 billion and less than $100 million, respectively.\n \nThe Company’s total balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was $1.4 billion lower at December 31, 2015 when\ncompared to December 31, 2014. 3M was able to manage the business with lower cash levels due to significant ongoing cash flow\ngeneration and proven access to capital markets funding throughout business cycles.\n \n38\n \nTable of Contents \nTotal Debt:\n \nThe Company’s total debt was $4.0 billion higher at December 31, 2015 when compared to December 31, 2014. The strength of 3M’s\ncapital structure and significant ongoing cash flows provide 3M proven access to capital markets. Additionally, the Company’s maturity\nprofile is staggered to help ensure refinancing needs in any given year are reasonable in proportion to the total portfolio. The Company has\nan AA- credit rating, with a stable outlook, from Standard & Poor’s and an Aa3 credit rating, with a negative outlook, from Moody’s\nInvestors Service. The Company’s ongoing transition to a better-optimized capital structure, financed with additional low-cost debt, could\nimpact 3M’s credit rating in the future.\n \nEffective May 16, 2014, the Company updated its “well-known seasoned issuer” shelf registration statement, which registers an\nindeterminate amount of debt or equity securities for future sales. This replaced 3M’s previous shelf registration dated August 5, 2011. In\nJune 2014, in connection with the May 16, 2014 shelf registration, 3M re-commenced its medium-term notes program (Series F) under\nwhich 3M may issue, from time to time, up to $9 billion aggregate principal amount of notes. Included in this $9 billion are $8.17 billion\n(utilizing the foreign exchange rate applicable at the time of issuance for the Euro denominated debt) of notes previously issued in 2011,\n2012, 2014, and 2015 as part of Series F.

Under the $2.25 billion credit agreement, the Company is required to maintain its EBITDA to\nInterest Ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter at not less than 3.0 to 1. This is calculated (as defined in the agreement) as the ratio of\nconsolidated total EBITDA for the four consecutive quarters then ended to total interest expense on all funded debt for the same period. At\nDecember 31, 2015, this ratio was approximately 56 to 1. Debt covenants do not restrict the payment of dividends. Apart from the\ncommitted facilities, an additional $241 million in stand-alone letters of credit and $18 million in bank guarantees were also issued and\noutstanding at December 31, 2015. These lines of credit are utilized in connection with normal business activities.\n \nBalance Sheet:\n \n3M’s strong balance sheet and liquidity provide the Company with significant flexibility to take advantage of numerous opportunities going\nforward. The Company will continue to invest in its operations to drive growth, including continual review of acquisition opportunities.\n \nVarious assets and liabilities, including cash and short-term debt, can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on short-term\nliquidity needs. Working capital (defined as current assets minus current liabilities) totaled $3.868 billion at December 31, 2015, compared\nwith $6.339 billion at December 31, 2014, a decrease of $2.471 billion. Current asset balance changes decreased working capital by $1.317\nbillion, driven by decreases in marketable securities. Current liability balance changes decreased working capital by $1.154 billion, driven\nby increases in short-term debt.\n \nThe Company uses various working capital measures that place emphasis and focus on certain working capital assets and liabilities. These\nmeasures are not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled\nmeasures used by other companies. One of the primary working capital measures 3M uses is a combined index, which includes accounts\nreceivable, inventories and accounts payable. This combined index (defined as quarterly net sales — fourth quarter at year-end —\nmultiplied by four, divided by ending net accounts receivable plus inventories less accounts payable) was 4.9 at December 31, 2015\ncompared to 5.0 at December 31, 2014. Receivables decreased $84 million, or 2.0 percent, compared with December 31, 2014,  as currency\ntranslation impacts decreased accounts receivable by $239 million, partially offset by 2015 acquisitions that added $103 million. Inventories\ndecreased $188 million, or 5.1 percent, compared with December 31, 2014. The inventory decrease was attributable to currency translation,\nwhich decreased inventories by $272 million, partially offset by 2015 acquisitions that added $102 million.  \n39\n \nTable of Contents \nAccounts payable decreased by $113 million compared with December 31, 2014, as currency translation impacts reduced accounts payable\nby $76 million.\n \nReturn on Invested Capital (non-GAAP measure):\n \nThe Company uses non-GAAP measures to focus on shareholder value creation. 3M uses return on invested capital (ROIC), defined as\nannualized after-tax operating income (including interest income) divided by average operating capital. Operating capital is defined as net\nassets (total assets less total liabilities) excluding debt. This measure is not recognized under U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to\nsimilarly titled measures used by other companies. ROIC was 22.5 percent for 2015, and 22.0 percent for 2014.\n \nCash Flows:\n \nCash flows from operating, investing and financing activities are provided in the tables that follow. Individual amounts in the Consolidated\nStatement of Cash Flows exclude the effects of acquisitions, divestitures and exchange rate impacts on cash and cash equivalents, which are\npresented separately in the cash flows. Thus, the amounts presented in the following operating, investing and financing activities tables\nreflect changes in balances from period to period adjusted for these effects.\n \nCash Flows from Operating Activities:\n \nYears Ended December 31\n        \n \n        \n \n        \n \n \n(Millions)\n \n2015\n \n2014\n \n2013\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nNet income including noncontrolling interest\n $\n4,841  $\n4,998  $\n4,721  \nDepreciation and amortization\n \n \n1,435  \n \n1,408  \n \n1,371  \nCompany pension contributions\n \n \n(264) \n \n(210) \n \n(476) \nCompany postretirement contributions\n \n \n(3) \n \n(5) \n \n(6) \nCompany pension expense\n \n \n442  \n \n310  \n \n446  \nCompany postretirement expense\n \n \n114  \n \n81  \n \n107  \nStock-based compensation expense\n \n \n276  \n \n280  \n \n240  \nIncome taxes (deferred and accrued income taxes)\n \n \n(349) \n \n60  \n \n39  \nExcess tax benefits from stock-based compensation\n \n \n(154) \n \n(167) \n \n(92) \nAccounts receivable\n \n \n(58) \n \n(268) \n \n(337) \nInventories\n \n \n3  \n \n(113) \n \n(86) \nAccounts payable\n \n \n9  \n \n75  \n \n16  \nOther — net\n \n \n128  \n \n177  \n \n(126) \nNet cash provided by operating activities\n $\n6,420  $\n6,626  $\n5,817  \n \nCash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period, as pension funding decisions, tax timing differences\nand other items can significantly impact cash flows.\n \nIn 2015, cash flows provided by operating activities decreased $206 million compared to 2014. Operating cash flows decreased due to $363\nmillion in higher cash income taxes when comparing 2015 to 2014, plus lower net income, which was partially offset by lower year-on-year\nworking capital requirements. The combination of accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable increased working capital by $46\nmillion in 2015, compared to increases of $306 million in 2014, with the year-on-year improvement related to lower organic volume growth.\nAdditional discussion on working capital changes is provided earlier in the “Financial Condition and Liquidity” section.\n \nIn 2014, cash flows provided by operating activities increased $809 million compared to 2013. Operating cash flows benefited year-on-year\nfrom increases in net income including noncontrolling interest, lower pension and postretirement plans contributions, and lower year-on-\nyear working capital requirements. The combination of accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable increased working capital by\n$306 million in 2014, compared to increases of $407 million in 2013, with the year-on-year improvement partially due to higher receivable\nand inventory turns. Additional discussion on working capital changes is provided earlier in the “Financial Condition and Liquidity” section.\n40\n \nTable of Contents \n \nFree Cash Flow (non-GAAP measure):\n \nIn addition, to net cash provided by operating activities, 3M believes free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are useful measures of\nperformance and uses these measures as an indication of the strength of the Company and its ability to generate cash. Free cash flow and\nfree cash flow conversion are not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Therefore, they should not be\nconsidered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled\nmeasures used by other companies. 3M defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant\nand equipment (which is classified as an investing activity). It should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for\ndiscretionary expenditures. 3M defines free cash flow conversion as free cash flow divided by net income attributable to 3M.

Finally, 3M also invests in other initiatives, such as information technology (IT) and corporate laboratory facilities.\n \nIn 2015, investments included new sites and buildings, investments in IT, continued expansion of current facilities and new facilities, plus\nthe sustainment of existing facilities, in addition to other initiatives. Specific investments in 2015 included a new state-of-the-art, four story,\n400,000 square foot research facility at 3M Center in St. Paul, Minnesota. In addition, 3M continued its investments it IT systems and\ninfrastructure, particularly the ongoing multi-year phased implementation of an ERP system.\n \nIn 2014, investments in growth across geographies included production equipment, new sites and buildings, capacity investments,\nconverting, and distribution, and other growth initiatives. Other investments include IT systems and infrastructure, including an ongoing\nmulti-year phased implementation of an ERP system on a worldwide basis. In\n41\n \nTable of Contents \naddition, 3M began a multi-year program in the United States to renew and upgrade laboratory facilities and administrative buildings.\n \nIn 2013, 3M continued its expansion of manufacturing capacity in key growth markets, including investments in the U.S., China, Germany,\nand Brazil. This included significant investments across 3M’s many businesses, such as abrasives, industrial adhesives and tapes, advanced\nmaterials, electronics-related, infection prevention, and other businesses. 3M continued its investments in IT systems and infrastructure. In\naddition, 3M sustained existing facilities through general maintenance, cost reduction, and compliance efforts.\n \nProceeds from sale of PP&E and other assets totaled $33 million in 2015, $135 million in 2014, and $128 million in 2013. Apart from the\nnormal periodic sales of PP&E, 2014 included proceeds of $114 million related to the sales of real estate and non-production equipment, and\n2013 included proceeds of $79 million related to non-production equipment.\n \nRefer to Note 2 for information on acquisitions and divestitures. The Company is actively considering additional acquisitions, investments\nand strategic alliances, and from time to time may also divest certain businesses.\n \nPurchases of marketable securities and investments and proceeds from maturities and sale of marketable securities and investments are\nprimarily attributable to asset-backed securities, agency securities, corporate debt securities and other securities, which are classified as\navailable-for-sale. Refer to Note 9 for more details about 3M’s diversified marketable securities portfolio.

Total debt\nwas 48 percent of total capital (total capital is defined as debt plus equity) at year-end 2015,  34 percent of total capital at year-end 2014,\nand 25 percent of total capital at year-end 2013.  \n \nIn both 2015 and 2014, the change in short-term debt primarily related to bank borrowings by international subsidiaries, primarily Japan\nand Korea in 2015. In 2015, repayment of debt primarily related to debt assumed (and paid off) as part of the Capital Safety acquisition\n(refer to Note 2). In 2014, repayment of debt primarily includes repayment of a Eurobond in July 2014 totaling 1.025 billion Euros\n(approximately $1.4 billion carrying value), repayment of the three-year 66 million British Pound committed credit facility agreement\nentered into in December 2012, and repayment of other international debt.

In addition, proceeds from debt for 2014 also include bank borrowings by international subsidiaries. Proceeds\nfrom debt in 2013 related to the November 2013 issuance of an eight-year Eurobond for an amount of 600 million Euros. Refer to Note 10\nfor additional discussion of debt.\n \nRepurchases of common stock are made to support the Company’s stock-based employee compensation plans and for other corporate\npurposes. In February 2016, 3M’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $10 billion of 3M’s outstanding common stock,\nwhich replaced the Company’s February 2014 repurchase program. This authorization has no pre-established end date. In 2015, 2014, and\n2013, the Company purchased more than $5 billion of its own stock each year. The Company expects full-year 2016 gross share\nrepurchases will be in the range of $4 billion to $6 billion. For more information, refer to the table titled “Issuer Purchases of Equity\nSecurities” in Part II, Item 5. The Company does not utilize derivative instruments linked to the Company’s stock.\n \nCash dividends paid to shareholders totaled $2.561 billion ($4.10 per share) in 2015, $2.216 billion ($3.42 per share) in 2014, and $1.730\nbillion ($2.54 per share) in 2013. 3M has paid dividends since 1916. In February 2016, 3M’s Board of Directors declared a first-quarter\n2016 dividend of $1.11 per share, an increase of 8  percent. This is equivalent to an annual dividend of $4.44 per share and marked the 58th\nconsecutive year of dividend increases.\n \nOn September 1, 2014, 3M purchased (via Sumitomo 3M Limited) Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd.’s 25 percent interest in 3M’s\nconsolidated Sumitomo 3M Limited subsidiary for 90 billion Japanese Yen. Upon completion of this transaction, 3M owned 100 percent of\nSumitomo 3M Limited. This was reflected as a “Purchase of noncontrolling interest” in the financing section of the consolidated statement\nof cash flows. In addition, in April 2014, 3M purchased the remaining noncontrolling interest in a consolidated 3M subsidiary for an\nimmaterial amount, which was also classified as a “Purchase of noncontrolling interest” in the financing section of the consolidated\nstatement of cash flows.\n \nIn March 2013, 3M sold shares in 3M India Limited, a subsidiary of the Company, in return for $8 million. The noncontrolling interest\nshares of this subsidiary trade on a public exchange in India. This sale of shares complied with an amendment to Indian securities\nregulations that required 3M India Limited, as a listed company, to achieve a minimum public shareholding of at least 25 percent. As a\nresult of this transaction, 3M’s ownership in 3M India Limited was reduced from 76 percent to 75 percent. The $8 million received in the\nfirst quarter of 2013 was classified as other financing activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows.\n \nIn addition to the March 2013 sale of noncontrolling interest described above, other cash flows from financing activities may include\nvarious other items, such as changes in cash overdraft balances, and principal payments for capital leases.\n \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations:\n \nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company has not utilized special purpose entities to facilitate off-balance sheet financing arrangements. Refer\nto the section entitled “Warranties/Guarantees” in Note 14 for discussion of accrued product warranty liabilities and guarantees.\n \nIn addition to guarantees, 3M, in the normal course of business, periodically enters into agreements that require the Company to indemnify\neither major customers or suppliers for specific risks, such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of the use of 3M products or\nthe negligence of 3M personnel, or claims alleging that 3M products infringe third-party patents or other intellectual property.

Interest projections on both floating and fixed rate long-term debt, including the effects of interest\nrate swaps, are based on effective interest rates as of December 31, 2015.\n \nUnconditional purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the\nCompany. Included in the unconditional purchase obligations category above are certain obligations related to take or pay contracts, capital\ncommitments, service agreements and utilities. These estimates include both unconditional purchase obligations with terms in excess of one\nyear and normal ongoing purchase obligations with terms of less than one year. Many of these commitments relate to take or pay contracts,\nin which 3M guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or services that are sold to customers. The Company expects to receive\nconsideration (products or services) for these unconditional purchase obligations. Contractual capital commitments are included in the\npreceding table, but these commitments represent a small part of the Company’s expected capital spending in 2016 and beyond. The\npurchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items for which the\nCompany is contractually obligated. The majority of 3M’s products and services are purchased as needed, with no unconditional\ncommitment. For this reason, these amounts will not provide a reliable indicator of the Company’s expected future cash outflows on a stand-\nalone basis.\n \nOther obligations, included in the preceding table within the caption entitled “Unconditional purchase obligations and other,” include the\ncurrent portion of the liability for uncertain tax positions under ASC 740, which is expected to be paid out in cash in the next 12 months.\nThe Company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the long-term payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or\ndecrease over time; therefore, the long-term portion of the net tax liability of $208 million is excluded from the preceding table. Refer to\nNote 8 for further details.\n \nAs discussed in Note 11, the Company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2016\nand Company contributions to its U.S. and international pension plans are expected to be largely discretionary in future years; therefore,\namounts related to these plans are not included in the preceding table.\n \nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n \nThe Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts, options and swaps to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on\ncash flows denominated in foreign currencies and certain intercompany financing transactions. The Company manages interest rate risks\nusing a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. To help manage borrowing costs, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps. Under these\narrangements, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated\nby reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. The Company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply\ncontracts, price protection agreements and forward contracts.\n44\n \nTable of Contents \n \nRefer to Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk”, for further discussion of foreign exchange rates risk,\ninterest rates risk, commodity prices risk and value at risk analysis.\n \nItem 7A. Quantitative  and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\n \nIn the context of Item 7A, 3M is exposed to market risk due to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange\nrates, interest rates and commodity prices. Changes in those factors could cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flows. Senior management\nprovides oversight for risk management and derivative activities, determines certain of the Company’s financial risk policies and objectives,\nand provides guidelines for derivative instrument utilization. Senior management also establishes certain associated procedures relative to\ncontrol and valuation, risk analysis, counterparty credit approval, and ongoing monitoring and reporting.\n \nThe Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties in interest rate swaps, currency swaps, commodity\nprice swaps, and forward and option contracts. However, the Company’s risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments. The Company\nactively monitors its exposure to credit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit limits, and by selecting major international banks\nand financial institutions as counterparties. The Company does not anticipate nonperformance by any of these counterparties.\n \nForeign Exchange Rates Risk:\n \nForeign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the Company’s net investment in foreign subsidiaries and may\ncause fluctuations in cash flows related to foreign denominated transactions. 3M is also exposed to the translation of foreign currency\nearnings to the U.S. dollar. The Company enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange\nrate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. These transactions are designated as cash flow hedges. 3M may\ndedesignate these cash flow hedge relationships in advance of the occurrence of the forecasted transaction. Beginning in the second quarter\nof 2014, 3M began extending the maximum length of time over which it hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows of the\nforecasted transactions from a previous term of 12 months to a longer term of 24 months, with certain currencies being extended further to\n36 months starting in the first quarter of 2015. In addition, 3M enters into foreign currency forward contracts that are not designated in\nhedging relationships to offset, in part, the impacts of certain intercompany activities (primarily associated with intercompany licensing\narrangements and intercompany financing transactions). As circumstances warrant, the Company also uses foreign currency forward\ncontracts and foreign currency denominated debt as hedging instruments to hedge portions of the Company’s net investments in foreign\noperations. The dollar equivalent gross notional amount of the Company’s foreign exchange forward and option contracts designated as cash\nflow hedges and those not designated as hedging instruments were $2.8 billion and $5.4 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2015. As of\nDecember 31, 2015, the Company had 974 million Euros and 248 billion South Korean Won in notional amount of foreign currency\nforward contracts designated as net investment hedges along with 3.6 billion Euros in principal amount of foreign currency denominated\ndebt designated as non-derivative hedging instruments in certain net investment hedges as discussed in Note 12 in the “Net Investment\nHedges” section.\n \nInterest Rates Risk:\n \nThe Company may be impacted by interest rate volatility with respect to existing debt and future debt issuances. 3M manages interest\nexpense using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. To help manage borrowing costs, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps that\nare designated and qualify as fair value hedges. Under these arrangements, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the\ndifference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. The dollar\nequivalent (based on inception date foreign currency exchange rates) gross notional amount of the Company’s interest rate swaps at\nDecember 31, 2015 was $1.8 billion. Additional details about 3M’s long-term debt can be found in Note 10, including references to\ninformation regarding derivatives and/or hedging instruments associated with the Company’s long-term debt.\n \n45\n \nTable of Contents \nCommodity Prices Risk:\n \nThe Company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and forward contracts. 3M\nused commodity price swaps as cash flow hedges of forecasted commodity transactions to manage price volatility, but discontinued this\npractice in the first quarter of 2015. The related mark-to-market gain or loss on qualifying hedges was included in other comprehensive\nincome to the extent effective, and reclassified into cost of sales in the period during which the hedged transaction affected earnings.\n \nValue At Risk:\n \nThe value at risk analysis is performed annuall\n\n--------------------------------\nAnd here is your task:\n\nExtract the exact total revenue (or net sales) figure for 2014 in billions of dollars.

A Monte Carlo simulation technique was used to test the impact on after-tax earnings related to financial instruments\n(primarily debt), derivatives and underlying exposures outstanding at December 31, 2015. The model (third-party bank dataset) used a 95\npercent confidence level over a 12-month time horizon. The exposure to changes in currency rates model used 18 currencies, interest rates\nrelated to three currencies, and commodity prices related to five commodities. This model does not purport to represent what actually will be\nexperienced by the Company. This model does not include certain hedge transactions, because the Company believes their inclusion would\nnot materially impact the results. The risk of loss or benefit associated with exchange rates was higher in 2015 due to a greater mix of\nfloating rate debt and a rising interest rate environment in the U.S. Interest rate volatility increased in 2015, based on a higher mix of\nfloating rate debt and the use of forward rates. The following table summarizes the possible adverse and positive impacts to after-tax\nearnings related to these exposures.\n \n \n \nAdverse impact on after-tax\n \nPositive impact on after-tax\n \n \n \nearnings\n \nearnings\n \n(Millions)\n    \n2015\n    \n2014\n    \n2015\n    \n2014\n \nForeign exchange rates\n $\n(254) \n$\n(164) $\n273  \n$\n173  \nInterest rates\n \n \n(13) \n \n(4) \n \n9  \n \n3  \nCommodity prices\n \n \n(1) \n \n(1) \n \n1  \n \n1  \n \nIn addition to the possible adverse and positive impacts discussed in the preceding table related to foreign exchange rates, recent historical\ninformation is as follows. 3M estimates that year-on-year currency effects, including hedging impacts, had the following effects on pre-tax\nincome: 2015 ($390 million decrease) and 2014 ($100 million decrease). This estimate includes the effect of translating profits from local\ncurrencies into U.S. dollars; the impact of currency fluctuations on the transfer of goods between 3M operations in the United States and\nabroad; and transaction gains and losses, including derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks and the\nnegative impact of swapping Venezuelan bolivars into U.S. dollars. 3M estimates that year-on-year derivative and other transaction gains\nand losses had the following effects on pre-tax income: 2015 ($180 million increase) and 2014 ($10 million increase).\n \nAn analysis of the global exposures related to purchased components and materials is performed at each year-end. A one percent price\nchange would result in a pre-tax cost or savings of approximately $70 million per year. The global energy exposure is such that a ten percent\nprice change would result in a pre-tax cost or savings of approximately $40 million per year. Global energy exposure includes energy costs\nused in 3M production and other facilities, primarily electricity and natural gas.\n46\n \nTable of Contents \nItem 8.

The financial statements\nhave been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Where necessary, the\nfinancial statements reflect estimates based on management’s judgment.\n \nManagement has established and maintains a system of internal control over financial reporting for the Company and its subsidiaries. This\nsystem and its established accounting procedures and related controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are\nsafeguarded, that the books and records properly reflect all transactions, that policies and procedures are implemented by qualified\npersonnel, and that published financial statements are properly prepared and fairly presented. The Company’s system of internal control\nover financial reporting is supported by widely communicated written policies, including business conduct policies, which are designed to\nrequire all employees to maintain high ethical standards in the conduct of Company affairs. Internal auditors continually review the\naccounting and control system.\n \n3M Company\n \nManagement’s Report  on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n \nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting. Management\nconducted an assessment of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established by the Committee\nof Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013).  Management’s assessment\nof the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 excluded Capital Safety Group\nS.A.R.L. and Polypore International, Inc.’s Separation Media Business, which were both acquired by the Company in August 2015 in\npurchase business combinations. These acquired businesses’ total assets and total net sales, in the aggregate, represented less than 2 percent\nand less than 1 percent, respectively, of the Company’s consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31,\n2015. Companies are allowed to exclude acquisitions from their assessment of internal control over financial reporting during the first year\nof acquisition while integrating the acquired company under guidelines established by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Based on\nthe assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2015, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective.\n \nThe Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an\nindependent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein, which expresses an unqualified opinion on\nthe effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015.\n \n3M Company\n48\n \nTable of Contents \nReport  of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n \nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors of 3M Company\n \nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of\n3M Company and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) at December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of\nthe three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica.  Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,\n2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (COSO).  The Company\'s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control\nover financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying\nManagement\'s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.  Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the\nCompany\'s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the\nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was\nmaintained in all material respects.  Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and\ndisclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the\noverall financial statement presentation.  Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control\nover financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exist\n\n--------------------------------\nAnd here is your task:\n\nExtract the exact total revenue (or net sales) figure for 2014 in billions of dollars.

Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We\nbelieve that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n \nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for marketable securities and\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities in 2015.\n \nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial\nreporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company’s\ninternal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are\nrecorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and\nexpenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a\nmaterial effect on the financial statements.\n \nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any\nevaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the\ndegree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n \nAs described in Management\'s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded Capital Safety Group S.A.R.L. (“Capital\nSafety”) and Polypore International, Inc.’s Separations Media Business (“Polypore Separations Media”) from its assessment of internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of December 31, 2015 because these businesses were acquired by the Company in purchase business combinations during\n2015.  We have also excluded Capital Safety and Polypore Separations Media from our audit of internal control over financial reporting.  Capital Safety\nis a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and the Company acquired the assets and liabilities of Polypore Separations Media whose total assets and\ntotal net sales, in the aggregate,

Significant Accounting Policies \n \nConsolidation: 3M is a diversified global manufacturer, technology innovator and marketer of a wide variety of products. All subsidiaries\nare consolidated. All intercompany transactions are eliminated. As used herein, the term “3M” or “Company” refers to 3M Company and\nsubsidiaries unless the context indicates otherwise.\n \nBasis of presentation: Certain balances relative to prior periods have been reclassified to conform to December 31, 2015 presentation in\nconnection with the following, each of which is further discussed in the indicated section of Note 1:\n·\nChange in method of classification of certain marketable securities previously classified as non-current to current as further\ndiscussed in the Marketable securities section; and\n·\nAdoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, and ASU\nNo. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, in the fourth quarter of 2015 on a retrospective basis as further\ndiscussed in the New Accounting Pronouncements section.\n \nForeign currency translation: Local currencies generally are considered the functional currencies outside the United States. Assets and\nliabilities for operations in local-currency environments are translated at month-end exchange rates of the period reported. Income and\nexpense items are translated at month-end exchange rates of each applicable month. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded as a\ncomponent of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders’ equity.\n \nAlthough local currencies are typically considered as the functional currencies outside the United States, under Accounting Standards\nCodification (ASC) 830, Foreign Currency Matters, the reporting currency of a foreign entity’s parent is assumed to be that entity’s\nfunctional currency when the economic environment of a foreign entity is highly inflationary—generally when its cumulative inflation is\napproximately 100 percent or more for the three years that precede the beginning of a reporting period. 3M has a subsidiary in Venezuela\nwith operating income representing less than 1.0 percent of 3M’s consolidated operating income for 2015. Since January 1, 2010, the\nfinancial statements of the Venezuelan subsidiary have been remeasured as if its functional currency were that of its parent.\n \nThe Venezuelan government sets official rates of exchange and conditions precedent to purchase foreign currency at these rates with local\ncurrency. Such rates and conditions have been and continue to be subject to change. In January 2014, the Venezuelan government\nannounced that the National Center for Foreign Commerce (CENCOEX), had assumed the role with respect to the continuation of the\nexisting official exchange rate, significantly expanded the use of a second currency auction exchange mechanism called the Complementary\nSystem for Foreign Currency Acquirement (or SICAD1), and issued exchange regulations indicating the SICAD1 rate of exchange would\nbe used for payments related to international investments. In late March 2014, the Venezuelan government launched a third foreign\nexchange mechanism, SICAD2, which it later replaced with another foreign currency exchange platform in February 2015 called the\nMarginal System of Foreign Currency (SIMADI). The SIMADI rate was described as being derived from daily private bidders and buyers\nexchanging offers through authorized agents. This rate is approved and published by the Venezuelan Central Bank.\n \nThe financial statements of 3M’s Venezuelan subsidiary were remeasured utilizing the official CENCOEX (or its predecessor) rate into\nMarch 2014, the SICAD1 rate beginning in late March 2014, the SICAD2 rate beginning in June 2014, and the SIMADI rate beginning in\nFebruary 2015. 3M’s uses of these rates were based upon evaluation of a number of factors including, but not limited to, the exchange rate\nthe Company’s Venezuelan subsidiary may legally use to convert currency, settle transactions or pay dividends; the probability of accessing\nand obtaining currency by use of a particular rate or mechanism; and the Company’s intent and ability to use a particular exchange\nmechanism. Other factors notwithstanding, remeasurement impacts of the changes in use of these exchange rates did not have material\nimpacts on 3M’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition.\n \nThe Company continues to monitor circumstances relative to its Venezuelan subsidiary. \n\n--------------------------------\nAnd here is your task:\n\nExtract the exact total revenue (or net sales) figure for 2014 in billions of dollars.

Changes in applicable exchange rates or exchange\nmechanisms may continue in the future. These changes could impact the rate of exchange applicable to remeasure the Company’s net\nmonetary assets (liabilities) denominated in Venezuelan Bolivars (VEF). As of\n55\n \nTable of Contents \nDecember 31, 2015, the Company had a balance of net monetary liabilities denominated in VEF of less than 500 million VEF and the\nCENCOEX, SICAD (formerly SICAD1), and SIMADI exchange rates were approximately 6 VEF, 13 VEF, and 200 VEF per U.S. dollar,\nrespectively.\n \nA need to deconsolidate the Company’s Venezuelan subsidiary’s operations may result from a lack of exchangeability of VEF-denominated\ncash coupled with an acute degradation in the ability to make key operational decisions due to government regulations in Venezuela. 3M\nmonitors factors such as its ability to access various exchange mechanisms; the impact of government regulations on the Company’s ability\nto manage its Venezuelan subsidiary’s capital structure, purchasing, product pricing, and labor relations; and the current political and\neconomic situation within Venezuela. Based upon such factors as of December 31, 2015, the Company continues to consolidate its\nVenezuelan subsidiary. As of December 31, 2015, the balance of intercompany receivables due from this subsidiary and its equity balance\nare not significant.\n \nReclassifications: Certain amounts in the prior years’ consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year\npresentation.\n \nUse of estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent\nassets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.\nActual results could differ from these estimates.\n \nCash and cash equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and temporary investments with maturities of three months or less\nwhen acquired.\n \nMarketable securities: Effective December 31, 2015, the Company changed the method of classification of certain securities previously\nclassified as non-current to current. This new method classifies these securities as current or non-current based on the nature of the securities\nand availability for use in current operations while the prior classification was based on management’s intended holding period, the\nsecurity’s maturity date and liquidity considerations based on market conditions. The Company believes this method is preferable because it\nis consistent with how the Company manages its capital structure and liquidity. The prior period balance has been reclassified to conform to\nthe current year presentation:\n \n \nDecember 31, 2014\n \n(Millions)\n    Previously Reported     \nImpact\n    \nAs Adjusted\n \nMarketable securities - current\n $\n626  $\n813  $\n1,439  \nMarketable securities - non-current\n  \n828   \n(813)  \n15  \nTotal marketable securities\n $\n1,454  $\n —  $\n1,454  \n \n3M reviews impairments associated with its marketable securities in accordance with the measurement guidance provided by ASC\n320, Investments-Debt and Equity Securities, when determining the classification of the impairment as “temporary” or “other-than-\ntemporary”. A temporary impairment charge results in an unrealized loss being recorded in the other comprehensive income component of\nshareholders’ equity. Such an unrealized loss does not reduce net income for the applicable accounting period because the loss is not viewed\nas other-than-temporary. The factors evaluated to differentiate between temporary and other-than-temporary include the projected future\ncash flows, credit ratings actions, and assessment of the credit quality of the underlying collateral, as well as other factors.\n \nInvestments: Investments primarily include equity method, cost method, and available-for-sale equity investments. Available-for-sale\ninvestments are recorded at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses relating to investments classified as available-for-sale are recorded as a\ncomponent of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders’ equity.\n \nOther assets: Other assets include deferred income taxes, product and other insurance receivables, the cash surrender value of life insurance\npolicies, and other long-term assets. Investments in life insurance are reported at the amount that could be realized under contract at the\nbalance sheet date, with any changes in cash surrender value or contract value during the period accounted for as an adjustment of premiums\npaid. Cash outflows and inflows associated with life\n56\n \nTable of Contents \ninsurance activity are included in “Purchases of marketable securities and investments” and “Proceeds from maturities and sale of\nmarketable securities and investments,” respectively.\n \nInventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost generally determined on a first-in, first-out basis.\n \nProperty, plant and equipment: Property, plant and equipment, including capitalized interest and internal engineering costs, are recorded at\ncost. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment generally is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives\nof the assets. The estimated useful lives of buildings and improvements primarily range from ten to forty years, with the majority in the\nrange of twenty to forty years. The estimated useful lives of machinery and equipment primarily range from three to fifteen years, with the\nmajority in the range of five to ten years. Fully depreciated assets are retained in property and accumulated depreciation accounts until\ndisposal. Upon disposal, assets and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the net amount, less proceeds from\ndisposal, is charged or credited to operations. Property, plant and equipment amounts are reviewed for impairment whenever events or\nchanges in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be\nrecognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the\nasset and its eventual disposition. The amount of the impairment loss recorded is calculated by the excess of the asset’s carrying value over\nits fair value. Fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis.\n \nConditional asset retirement obligations: A liability is initially recorded at fair value for an asset retirement obligation associated with the\nretirement of tangible long-lived assets in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. Conditional\nasset retirement obligations exist for certain long-term assets of the Company. The obligation is initially measured at fair value using\nexpected present value techniques. Over time the liabilities are accreted for the change in their present value and the initial capitalized costs\nare depreciated over the remaining useful lives of the related assets. The asset retirement obligation liability was $102 million and $96\nmillion at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\n \nGoodwill: Goodwill is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a\nbusiness combination. Goodwill is not amortized. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year, and is tested\nfor impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired.\nImpairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level, with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. Reporting units are one level\nbelow the business segment level, but can be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic\ncharacteristics. 3M did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing. An impairment loss generally would be recognized\nwhen the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. The estimated fair value of\na reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a price/earnings ratio for comparable industry groups, or by\nusing a discounted cash flow analysis. Companies have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of a\nreporting unit is not “more likely than not” less than its carrying amount, which is commonly referred to as “Step 0”. 3M has chosen not to\napply Step 0 for 2015 or prior period annual goodwill assessments.\n \nIntangible assets: Intangible asset types include customer related, patents, other technology-based, tradenames and other intangible assets\nacquired from an independent party. Intangible assets with a definite life are amortized over a period ranging from one to twenty years on a\nsystematic and rational basis (generally straight line) that is representative of the asset’s use. The estimated useful lives vary by category,\nwith customer related largely between seven to seventeen years, patents largely between five to thirteen years, other technology-based\nlargely between two to fifteen years, definite lived tradenames largely between three and twenty years, and other intangibles largely\nbetween two to ten years. Costs related to internally developed intangible assets, such as patents, are expensed as incurred, primarily in\n“Research, development and related expenses.”\n \nIntangible assets with a definite life are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an\nasset (asset group) may not be recoverable.

The\n57\n \nTable of Contents \namount of the impairment loss recorded is calculated by the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value. Fair value is generally\ndetermined using a discounted cash flow analysis.\n \nIntangible assets with an indefinite life, namely certain tradenames, are not amortized. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for\nimpairment annually, and are tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that\nthe carrying amount may be impaired. An impairment loss generally would be recognized when the fair value is less than the carrying value\nof the indefinite-lived intangible asset.\n \nRestructuring actions: Restructuring actions generally include significant actions involving employee-related severance charges, contract\ntermination costs, and impairment or accelerated depreciation/amortization of assets associated with such actions. Employee-related\nseverance charges are largely based upon distributed employment policies and substantive severance plans. These charges are reflected in\nthe quarter when the actions are probable and the amounts are estimable, which typically is when management approves the associated\nactions. Severance amounts for which affected employees were required to render service in order to receive benefits at their termination\ndates were measured at the date such benefits were communicated to the applicable employees and recognized as expense over the\nemployees’ remaining service periods. Contract termination and other charges primarily reflect costs to terminate a contract before the end\nof its term (measured at fair value at the time the Company provided notice to the counterparty) or costs that will continue to be incurred\nunder the contract for its remaining term without economic benefit to the Company. Asset impairment charges related to intangible assets\nand property, plant and equipment reflect the excess of the assets’ carrying values over their fair values.\n \nRevenue (sales) recognition: The Company sells a wide range of products to a diversified base of customers around the world and has no\nmaterial concentration of credit risk. Revenue is recognized when the risks and rewards of ownership have substantively transferred to\ncustomers. This condition normally is met when the product has been delivered or upon performance of services. The Company records\nestimated reductions to revenue or records expense for customer and distributor incentives, primarily comprised of rebates and free goods, at\nthe time of the initial sale. These sales incentives are accounted for in accordance with ASC 605, Revenue Recognition. The estimated\nreductions of revenue for rebates are based on the sales terms, historical experience, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the\nvarious markets served. Since the Company serves numerous markets, the rebate programs offered vary across businesses, but the most\ncommon incentive relates to amounts paid or credited to customers for achieving defined volume levels or growth objectives. Free goods are\naccounted for as an expense and recorded in cost of sales. Sales, use, value-added and other excise taxes are not recognized in revenue.\n \nThe vast majority of 3M’s sales agreements are for standard products and services with customer acceptance occurring upon delivery of the\nproduct or performance of the service. However, to a limited extent 3M also enters into agreements that involve multiple elements (such as\nequipment, installation and service), software, or non-standard terms and conditions.\n \nFor non-software multiple-element arrangements, the Company recognizes revenue for delivered elements when they have stand-alone\nvalue to the customer, they have been accepted by the customer, and for which there are only customary refund or return rights.\nArrangement consideration is allocated to the deliverables by use of the relative selling price method. The selling price used for each\ndeliverable is based on vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) if available, third-party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available, or\nestimated selling price if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. Estimated selling price is determined in a manner consistent with that used to\nestablish the price to sell the deliverable on a standalone basis. In addition to the preceding conditions, equipment revenue is not recorded\nuntil the installation has been completed if equipment acceptance is dependent upon installation or if installation is essential to the\nfunctionality of the equipment. Installation revenues are not recorded until installation has been completed.\n \nFor arrangements (or portions of arrangements) falling within software revenue recognition standards and that do not involve significant\nproduction, modification, or customization, revenue for each software or software-related element is recognized when the Company has\nVSOE of the fair value of all of the undelivered elements and applicable criteria have been met for the delivered elements. When the\narrangements involve significant production, modification or customization, long-term construction-type accounting involving proportional\nperformance is generally employed.\n \n58\n \nTable of Contents \nFor prepaid service contracts, sales revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract, unless historical evidence\nindicates the costs are incurred on other than a straight-line basis. License fee revenue is recognized as earned, and no revenue is recognized\nuntil the inception of the license term.\n \nOn occasion, agreements will contain milestones, or 3M will recognize revenue based on proportional performance. For these agreements,\nand depending on the specifics, 3M may recognize revenue upon completion of a substantive milestone, or in proportion to costs incurred to\ndate compared with the estimate of total costs to be incurred.\n \nAccounts receivable and allowances: Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company\nmaintains allowances for bad debts, cash discounts, product returns and various other items. The allowance for doubtful accounts and\nproduct returns is based on the best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in existing accounts receivable and anticipated sales\nreturns. The Company determines the allowances based on historical write-off experience by industry and regional economic data and\nhistorical sales returns. The Company reviews the allowance for doubtful accounts monthly. The Company does not have any significant\noff-balance-sheet credit exposure related to its customers.\n \nAdvertising and merchandising: These costs are charged to operations in the period incurred, and totaled $368 million in 2015, $407 million\nin 2014 and $423 million in 2013.\n \nResearch, development and related expenses: These costs are charged to operations in the period incurred and are shown on a separate line\nof the Consolidated Statement of Income. Research, development and related expenses totaled $1.763 billion in 2015, $1.770 billion in 2014\nand $1.715 billion in 2013. Research and development expenses, covering basic scientific research and the application of scientific\nadvances in the development of new and improved products and their uses, totaled $1.223 billion in 2015, $1.193 billion in 2014 and $1.150\nbillion in 2013. Related expenses primarily include technical support; internally developed patent costs, which include costs and fees\nincurred to prepare, file, secure and maintain patents; amortization of externally acquired patents and externally acquired in-process research\nand development; and gains/losses associated with certain corporate approved investments in R&D-related ventures, such as equity method\neffects and impairments.\n \nInternal-use software: The Company capitalizes direct costs of services used in the development of internal-use software. Amounts\ncapitalized are amortized over a period of three to seven years, generally on a straight-line basis, unless another systematic and rational basis\nis more representative of the software’s use. Amounts are reported as a component of either machinery and equipment or capital leases\nwithin property, plant and equipment.\n \nEnvironmental: Environmental expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or\nfuture revenues are expensed. Reserves for liabilities related to anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when\nthey are probable and reasonably estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies, the Company’s commitment to a\nplan of action, or approval by regulatory agencies. Environmental expenditures for capital projects that contribute to current or future\noperations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.\n \nIncome taxes: The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach. Under this approach, deferred income\ntaxes represent the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and\nliabilities. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets when uncertainty regarding their realizability exists.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had valuation allowances of $31 million and $22 million on its deferred tax assets,\nrespectively. The increase in valuation allowance at December 31, 2015 relates to current acquisitions in certain international jurisdictions.\nThe Company recognizes and measures its uncertain tax positions based on the rules under ASC 740, Income Taxes.\n \nEarnings per share: The difference in the weighted average 3M shares outstanding for calculating basic and diluted earnings per share\nattributable to 3M common shareholders is the resul\n\n--------------------------------\nAnd here is your task:\n\nExtract the exact total revenue (or net sales) figure for 2014 in billions of dollars.

Under\napplicable accounting standards, the fair value of share-based compensation is determined at the grant date and the recognition of the related\nexpense is recorded over the period in which the share-based compensation vests. Refer to Note 15 for additional information.\n \nComprehensive income: Total comprehensive income and the components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are presented\nin the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity. Accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss) is composed of foreign currency translation effects (including hedges of net investments in international\ncompanies), defined benefit pension and postretirement plan adjustments, unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt and equity\nsecurities, and unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedging instruments.\n \nDerivatives and hedging activities: All derivative instruments within the scope of ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, are recorded on the\nbalance sheet at fair value. The Company uses interest rate swaps, currency and commodity price swaps, and foreign currency forward and\noption contracts to manage risks generally associated with foreign exchange rate, interest rate and commodity market volatility. All hedging\ninstruments that qualify for hedge accounting are designated and effective as hedges, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting\nprinciples. If the underlying hedged transaction ceases to exist, all changes in fair value of the related derivatives that have not been settled\nare recognized in current earnings. Instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are marked to market with changes recognized in\ncurrent earnings. Cash flows from derivative instruments are classified in the statement of cash flows in the same category as the cash flows\nfrom the items subject to designated hedge or undesignated (economic) hedge relationships. The Company does not hold or issue derivative\nfinancial instruments for trading purposes and is not a party to leveraged derivatives.\n \nCredit risk: The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties in interest rate swaps, currency swaps,\ncommodity price swaps, and forward and option contracts. However, the Company’s risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments. The\nCompany actively monitors its exposure to credit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit limits, and by selecting major\ninternational banks and financial institutions as counterparties. 3M enters into master netting arrangements with counterparties when\npossible to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions. A master netting arrangement may allow each counterparty to net settle amounts\nowed between a 3M entity and the counterparty as a result of multiple, separate derivative transactions. The Company does not anticipate\nnonperformance by any of these counterparties. 3M has elected to present the fair value of derivative assets and\n60\n \nTable of Contents \nliabilities within the Company’s consolidated balance sheet on a gross basis even when derivative transactions are subject to master netting\narrangements and may otherwise qualify for net presentation.\n \nFair value measurements: 3M follows ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, with respect to assets and liabilities that are\nmeasured at fair value on a recurring basis and nonrecurring basis. Under the standard, fair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount\nthat would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the\nmeasurement date. The standard also establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable\ninputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs\nare inputs market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent\nof the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions about the factors market participants would use in\nvaluing the asset or liability developed based upon the best information available in the circumstances. The hierarchy is broken down into\nthree levels. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs include quoted\nprices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not\nactive, and inputs (other than quoted prices) that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are\nunobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is\nsignificant to the fair value measurement.\n \nAcquisitions: The Company accounts for business acquisitions in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations.  This standard requires\nthe acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all (and only) the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction and\nestablishes the acquisition-date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business\ncombination. Certain provisions of this standard prescribe, among other things, the determination of acquisition-date fair value of\nconsideration paid in a business combination (including contingent consideration) and the exclusion of transaction and acquisition-related\nrestructuring costs from acquisition accounting.\n \nNew Accounting Pronouncements\n \nIn April 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2014-08, Reporting Discontinued Operations and\nDisclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity, which changed the criteria for determining which disposals can be presented as\ndiscontinued operations and modified related disclosure requirements. This standard has the impact of reducing the frequency of disposals\nreported as discontinued operations, by requiring such a disposal to represent a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on an\nentity’s operations and financial results. However, existing provisions that prohibited an entity from reporting a discontinued operation if it\nhad certain continuing cash flows or involvement with the component after disposal were eliminated by this standard. The ASU also\nexpands the disclosures for discontinued operations and requires new disclosures related to individually significant disposals that do not\nqualify as discontinued operations. For 3M, this ASU was effective prospectively beginning January 1, 2015. This ASU was applied to the\n2015 divestiture information discussed in Note 2 and had no material impact on consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\n \nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and in August 2015 issued ASU No. 2015-14,\nwhich amended ASU No. 2014-09 as to effective date. The ASU, as amended, provides a single comprehensive model to be used in the\naccounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-\nspecific guidance. The standard’s stated core principle is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or\nservices to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or\nservices. To achieve this core principle the ASU includes provisions within a five step model that includes identifying the contract with a\ncustomer, identifying the performance obligations in the contract, determining the transaction price, allocating the transaction price to the\nperformance obligations, and recognizing revenue when (or as) an entity satisfies a performance obligation. The standard also specifies the\naccounting for some costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer and requires expanded disclosures about revenue recognition. The\nstandard provides for either full retrospective adoption or a modified retrosp\n\n--------------------------------\nAnd here is your task:\n\nExtract the exact total revenue (or net sales) figure for 2014 in billions of dollars.

For 3M, the ASU, as\n61\n \nTable of Contents \namended, is effective January 1, 2018. The Company is currently assessing this standard’s impact on 3M’s consolidated results of\noperations and financial condition.\n \nIn February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis, which changes guidance related to both\nthe variable interest entity (VIE) and voting interest entity (VOE) consolidation models. With respect to the VIE model, the standard\nchanges, among other things, the identification of variable interests associated with fees paid to a decision maker or service provider, the\nVIE characteristics for a limited partner or similar entity, and the primary beneficiary determination. With respect to the VOE model, the\nASU eliminates the presumption that a general partner controls a limited partnership or similar entity unless the presumption can otherwise\nbe overcome. Under the new guidance, a general partner would largely not consolidate a partnership or similar entity under the VOE model.\nFor 3M, this ASU is effective January 1, 2016, with early adoption permitted. 3M does not have significant involvement with entities\nsubject to consolidation considerations impacted by the VIE model changes or with limited partnerships potentially impacted by the VOE\nmodel changes. As a result, 3M does not expect this ASU to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\n   \nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, and in August 2015 issued ASU\nNo. 2015-15, Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements. Under ASU\n2015-03, debt issuance costs reported on the consolidated balance sheet would be reflected as a direct deduction from the related debt\nliability rather than as an asset. While ASU 2015-03 addresses costs related to term debt, ASU No. 2015-15 provides clarification regarding\ncosts to secure revolving lines of credit, which are, at the outset, not associated with an outstanding borrowing. ASU No. 2015-15 provides\ncommentary that the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting costs associated with line-of-credit arrangements as an\nasset and subsequently amortizing them ratably over the term of the revolving debt arrangement. For 3M, ASU No. 2015-03 is effective\nJanuary 1, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this ASU in the fourth quarter of 2015 with retrospective application\nto prior periods. As a result, debt issue costs aggregating $26 million previously included within Other Assets have been reflected as\nreductions in the balances of Long-Term Debt as of December 31, 2014.\n \nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-05, Customer’s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Arrangement, which requires a\ncustomer to determine whether a cloud computing arrangement contains a software license. If the arrangement contains a software license,\nthe customer would account for fees related to the software license element in a manner consistent with accounting for the acquisition of\nother acquired software licenses. If the arrangement does not contain a software license, the customer would account for the arrangement as\na service contract. An arrangement would contain a software license element if both (1) the customer has the contractual right to take\npossession of the software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and (2) it is feasible for the customer to either\nrun the software on its own hardware or contract with another party unrelated to the vendor to host the software. For 3M, this ASU is\neffective January 1, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The standard provides for adoption either fully retrospectively or prospectively to\narrangements entered into, or materially modified, after the effective date. The Company does not expect this ASU to have a material impact\non 3M’s consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\n \nIn May 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-07, Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share\n(or Its Equivalent). This standard modifies existing disclosure requirements such that investments for which the practical expedient is used\nto measure their fair value at net asset value (NAV) would be removed from the fair value hierarchy disclosures. Instead, an entity would be\nrequired to include those investments as a reconciling item such that the total fair value amount of investments in the fair value hierarchy\ndisclosure is consistent with the amount on the balance sheet. Changes were also made to the requirements in a sponsor’s employee benefit\nplan asset disclosures. For 3M, this standard is effective January 1, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this ASU in\nthe fourth quarter of 2015 with retrospective application to prior periods. As a result, Note 11, Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans,\nreflects the modified disclosures with respect to applicable plan assets. As this ASU only relates to certain disclosures, it did not impact the\nCompany’s consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\n \nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory, which modifies existing requirements\nregarding measuring inventory at the lower of cost or market. Under existing standards, the market amount requires consideration of\nreplacement cost, net realizable value (NRV), and NRV less an approximately normal profit\n62\n \nTable of Contents \nmargin. The new ASU replaces market with NRV, defined as estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably\npredictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. This eliminates the need to determine and consider replacement cost or NRV\nless an approximately normal profit margin when measuring inventory. For 3M, this standard is effective prospectively beginning January 1,\n2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing this ASU’s impacts on 3M’s consolidated results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\n   \nIn September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments, that eliminates\nthe requirement for an acquirer in a business combination to account for measurement-period adjustments retrospectively. Under existing\nstandards, an acquirer in a business combination reports provisional amounts with respect to acquired assets and liabilities when their\nmeasurements are incomplete as of the end of the reporting period. Prior to the impact of this ASU, an acquirer is required to adjust\nprovisional amounts (and the related impact on earnings) by restating prior period financial statements during the measurement period\nwhich cannot exceed one year from the date of acquisition. The new guidance requires that the cumulative impact of a measurement-period\nadjustment (including the impact on prior periods) be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment is identified—eliminating\nthe requirement to restate prior period financial statements. The new standard requires disclosure of the nature and amount of measurement-\nperiod adjustments as well as information with respect to the portion of the adjustments recorded in current-period earnings that would have\nbeen recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustments to provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. The\nASU is applied prospectively to measurement-period adjustments that occur after the effective date. For 3M, this standard is required\nprospectively beginning January 1, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this standard with respect to measurement-\nperiod adjustments beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015. Additional disclosure, as applicable, is included in Note 2, Acquisitions and\nDivestitures.\n \nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which requires entities to present\ndeferred tax assets (DTAs) and deferred tax liabilities (DTLs), along with any related valuation allowance, as noncurrent in a balance sheet.\nThis ASU eliminates current guidance requiring deferred taxes for each jurisdiction to be presented as a net current asset or liability and a\nnet noncurrent asset or liability. As a result, each jurisdiction would have one net noncurrent DTA or DTL balance. The ASU does not\nchange the existing requirement that only permits offsetting DTAs and DTLs within a particular jurisdiction. For 3M, this standard is\neffective January 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted. In light of the process simplification provided by this ASU, the Company adopted\nthis standard in the fourth quarter of 2015 with retrospective application to prior periods. As a result, the December 31, 2014 balances of\nDTAs and DTLs previously reported were impacted as follows:\n \n \nDecember 31, 2014\n \n(Millions)\n    Previously Reported     \nImpact\n    \nAs Adopted\n \nPrepaid expenses and other (within other current assets)\n $\n595  $\n169  $\n764  \nOther current tax assets (within other current assets)\n \n \n444   \n(444)  \n —  \nDeferred tax assets (within other assets)\n  \n889   \n241   \n1,130  \nDeferred tax liabilities (within other current liabilities)\n \n \n34   \n(34)  \n —  \n \nIn conjunction with the adoption of this ASU, 3M reclassified $169 million of remaining other current tax assets to prepaid expenses and\nother to conform to the 2015 presentation.\n \nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which\nrevises the accounting related to (1) the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and (2) the presentation of certain\nfair value changes for fin\n\n--------------------------------\nAnd here is your task:\n\nExtract the exact total revenue (or net sales) figure for 2014 in billions of dollars.

The ASU also amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the\nfair value of financial instruments. The new guidance requires the fair value measurement of investments in equity securities and other\nownership interests in an entity, including investments in partnerships, unincorporated joint ventures and limited liability companies\n(collectively, equity securities) that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method. Entities will need to\nmeasure these investments and recognize changes in fair value in net income. Entities will no longer be able to recognize unrealized holding\ngains and losses on equity securities they classify under current guidance as available for sale in other comprehensive income (OCI). They\nalso will no longer be able to use the cost method of accounting for equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values.\nInstead, for these types of equity investments that do not otherwise qualify for the net asset value practical expedient, entities will be\npermitted to elect a practicability exception and\n63\n \nTable of Contents \nmeasure the investment at cost less impairment plus or minus observable price changes (in orderly transactions). The ASU also establishes\nan incremental recognition and disclosure requirement related to the presentation of fair value changes of financial liabilities for which the\nfair value option (FVO) has been elected. Under this guidance, an entity would be required to separately present in OCI the portion of the\ntotal fair value change attributable to instrument-specific credit risk as opposed to reflecting the entire amount in earnings. For derivative\nliabilities for which the FVO has been elected, however, any changes in fair value attributable to instrument-specific credit risk would\ncontinue to be presented in net income, which is consistent with current guidance. For 3M, this standard is effective beginning January 1,\n2018 via a cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings, except for guidance relative to equity securities without readily\ndeterminable fair values which is applied prospectively. The Company is currently assessing this ASU’s impacts on 3M’s consolidated\nresults of operations and financial condition.\n \n NOTE 2.  Acquisitions and Divestitures\n \nAcquisitions:\n \n3M makes acquisitions of certain businesses from time to time that are aligned with its strategic intent with respect to, among other factors,\ngrowth markets and adjacent product lines or technologies.\n \nThe impact on the consolidated balance sheet of the purchase price allocations related to 2015 acquisitions and assigned weighted-average\nintangible asset lives, including adjustments relative to other acquisitions within the measurement period, follows. The allocation of purchase\nconsideration related to the August 2015 Capital Safety and Polypore Separations Media acquisitions is considered preliminary, primarily\nwith respect to certain tax-related assets and liabilities. 3M expects to finalize the allocation of purchase price within the one year\nmeasurement-period following these acquisitions. Adjustments to preliminary allocations primarily related to the identification and\nvaluation of certain indefinite-lived intangible assets (further discussed below). The change to provisional amounts resulted in an immaterial\nimpact to results of operations in the fourth quarter of 2015, a portion of which relates to earlier quarters in the measurement period.\n \n \n2015 Acquisition Activity\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \nFinite-Lived  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n Intangible-Asset \n(Millions)\n    \nCapital\n    \nPolypore\n        \n \n        \n \n    \nWeighted-\nAverage\n \nAsset (Liability)\n \nSafety\n \nSeparations Media\n \nOther\n \nTotal\n \nLives (Years)  \nAccounts receivable\n $\n66  $\n30  $\n7  $\n103   \n \nInventory\n  \n63  \n \n35  \n \n4  \n \n102   \n \nOther current assets\n  \n10  \n \n1  \n \n1  \n \n12   \n \nProperty, plant, and equipment\n  \n36  \n \n128  \n \n7  \n \n171   \n \nPurchased finite-lived intangible assets:\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n   \n \nCustomer related intangible assets\n  \n445  \n \n270  \n \n40  \n \n755  \n16  \nPatents\n \n \n44  \n \n11  \n \n7  \n \n62  \n7  \nOther technology-based intangible assets\n \n \n85  \n \n42  \n \n1  \n \n128  \n7  \nDefinite-lived tradenames\n \n \n26  \n \n6  \n \n1  \n \n33  \n16  \nOther amortizable intangible assets\n \n \n —  \n \n —  \n \n2  \n \n2  \n4  \nPurchased indefinite-lived intangible assets\n  \n520  \n \n —  \n \n —  \n \n520   \n \nPurchased goodwill\n  \n1,764  \n \n636  \n \n95  \n \n2,495   \n \nAccounts payable and other liabilities, net of other assets\n  \n(105) \n \n(122) \n \n(5) \n \n(232)  \n \nInterest bearing debt\n  \n(766) \n \n —  \n \n —  \n \n(766)  \n \nDeferred tax asset/(liability)\n  \n(464) \n \n —  \n \n(7) \n \n(471)  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n   \n \nNet assets acquired\n $\n1,724  $\n1,037  $\n153  $\n2,914   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n   \n \nSupplemental information:\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n   \n \nCash paid\n $\n1,758  $\n1,037  $\n154  $\n2,949   \n \nLess: Cash acquired\n  \n34  \n \n —  \n \n1  \n \n35   \n \nCash paid, net of cash acquired\n $\n1,724  $\n1,037  $\n153  $\n2,914   \n \n \n64\n \nTable of Contents \n3M completed one acquisition (Treo Solutions, LLC) during 2014, the impact of which on the consolidated balance sheet was not\nconsidered material. Separately, as discussed in Note 6, during 2014, 3M (via Sumitomo 3M Limited) purchased Sumitomo Electric\nIndustries, Ltd.’s 25 percent interest in 3M’s consolidated Sumitomo 3M Limited subsidiary for 90 billion Japanese Yen. Because 3M\nalready had a controlling interest in this consolidated subsidiary, this transaction was separately recorded as a financing activity in the\nstatement of cash flows.\n \nThere were no acquisitions that closed during 2013.\n \nGoodwill resulting from business combinations is largely attributable to the existing workforce of the acquired businesses and synergies\nexpected to arise after 3M’s acquisition of these businesses. Pro forma information related to acquisitions was not included because the\nimpact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations was not considered to be material.\n \nIn addition to business combinations, 3M periodically acquires certain tangible and/or intangible assets and purchases interests in certain\nenterprises that do not otherwise qualify for accounting as business combinations. These transactions are largely reflected as additional asset\npurchase and investment activity.\n \n2015 acquisitions:\n \nIn March 2015, 3M (Health Care Business) purchased all of the outstanding shares of Ivera Medical Corp., headquartered in San Diego,\nCalifornia. Ivera Medical Corp. is a manufacturer of health care products that disinfect and protect devices used for access into a patient’s\nbloodstream. In addition, in the first quarter of 2015, 3M (Industrial Business) purchased the remaining interest in a former equity method\ninvestment for an immaterial amount.\n \nIn August 2015, 3M (Safety and Graphics Business) acquired all of the outstanding shares of Capital Safety Group S.A.R.L., with operating\nheadquarters in Bloomington, Minnesota, from KKR & Co. L.P. for $1.7 billion, net of cash acquired. The net assets acquired included the\nassumption of $0.8 billion of debt. Capital Safety is a leading global provider of fall protection equipment.\n \nIn August 2015, 3M (Industrial Business) acquired the assets and liabilities associated with Polypore International, Inc.’s Separations Media\nbusiness, headquartered in Wuppertal, Germany, for $1.0 billion. Polypore’s Separations Media business is a leading provider of\nmicroporous membranes and modules for filtration in the life sciences, industrial and specialty segments.\n \nPurchased identifiable finite-lived intangible assets related to acquisition activity in 2015 totaled $1.0 billion. The associated finite-lived\nintangible assets acquired in 2015 will be amortized on a systematic and rational basis (generally straight line) over a weighted-average life\nof 14 years (lives ranging from two to 20 years). Indefinite-lived intangible assets of $520 million relate to certain tradenames associated\nwith the Capital Safety acquisition which have been in existence for over 55 years, have a history of leading market-share positions, have\nbeen and are intended to be continuously renewed, and the associated products of which are expected to generate cash flows for 3M for an\nindefinite period of time. Acquired in-process research and development and identifiable intangible assets for which significant assumed\nrenewals or extensions of underlying arrangements impacted the determination of their useful lives were not material.\n \n2014 acquisitions:\n \nDuring 2014, 3M completed one business combination. The purchase price paid for this business combination (net of cash acquired) and the\nimpact of other matters (net) during 2014 aggregated to $94 million.\n \nIn April 2014, 3M (Health Care Business) purchased all of the outstanding equity interests of Treo Solutions LLC, headquartered in Troy,\nNew York. Treo Solutions LLC is a provider of data analytics and business intelligence to healthcare payers and providers.\n \n65\n \nTable of Contents \nPurchased identifiable finite-lived intangible assets related to acquisition activity in 2014 totaled $34 million. The associated finite-lived\nintangible assets acquired in 2014 will be amortized on a systematic and rational basis (generally straight line) over a weighted-average life\nof six years (lives ranging from three to 10 years). Acquired in-process research and development and identifiable intangible assets for\nwhich significant assumed renewals or extensions of underlying arrangements impacted the determination of their useful lives were not\nmaterial.\n \nDivestitures:\n \n3M may divest certain businesses from time to time based upon review of the Company’s portfolio considering, among other items, factors\nrelative to the extent of strategic and technological alignment and optimization of capital deployment, in additio\n\n--------------------------------\nAnd here is your task:\n\nExtract the exact total revenue (or net sales) figure for 2014 in billions of dollars.

This transaction was not considered material.\n \nIn the fourth quarter of 2015, 3M (Safety and Graphics Business) entered into agreements with One Equity Partners Capital Advisors L.P.\n(OEP) to sell the assets of 3M’s library systems business. The sales of the North American business and the majority of the business outside\nof North America closed in October and November 2015, respectively. The sale of the remainder of the library systems business is expected\nto close in the first quarter of 2016. In December 2015, 3M (Safety and Graphics Business) also completed the sale of Faab Fabricauto, a\nwholly-owned subsidiary of 3M, to Hills Numberplates Limited. The library systems business, part of the Traffic Safety and Security\nDivision, delivers circulation management solutions to library customers with on-premise hardware and software, maintenance and service,\nand an emerging cloud-based digital lending platform. Faab Fabricauto, also part of the Traffic Safety and Security Division, is a leading\nFrench manufacturer of license plates and signage solutions. The aggregate cash proceeds relative to the 2015 global library systems and\nFaab Fabricauto divestiture transactions was $104 million. The Company recorded a net pre-tax gain of $40 million (approximately $10\nmillion after tax) in 2015 as a result of the sale and any adjustment of carrying value.\n \nIn January 2016, 3M (Industrial Business Group) entered into an agreement to sell to Innovative Chemical Products Group, a portfolio\ncompany of Audax Private Equity, the assets of 3M’s pressurized polyurethane foam adhesives business (formerly known as Polyfoam).\nThis business is a provider of pressurized polyurethane foam adhesive formulations and systems into the residential roofing, commercial\nroofing and insulation and industrial foam segments in the United States with annual sales of approximately $20 million. The transaction is\nexpected to close in the first quarter of 2016, subject to customary close conditions.\n \nIn June 2013, 3M (Consumer Business) completed the sale of its Scientific Anglers and Ross Reels businesses to The Orvis Company, Inc.\nbased in Manchester, Vermont.

Upon completion of the transaction, 3M owned 100 percent of\nSumitomo 3M Limited.

This sale of shares complied with an amendment to Indian securities\nregulations that required 3M India Limited, as a listed company, to achieve a minimum public shareholding of at least 25 percent. As a\nresult of this transaction, 3M’s ownership in 3M India Limited was reduced from 76 percent to 75 percent.

As a result of this transaction, in the third quarter of\n2013, 3M recorded a pre-tax gain of $18 million in its Health Care business segment. In October 2013, cash was received for the\nnote receivable and is reflected in other investing activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December\n31, 2013.\n \n·\nDuring the second quarter of 2013, the Company’s Sumitomo 3M Limited subsidiary moved its administrative headquarters to a\nnew leased location and sold the former site under an installment sale arrangement. As a result, at the time of the closing of the\nsale transaction, the Company received certain cash proceeds (included in proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment in\nthe consolidated statement of cash flows) and recorded a note receivable (due in quarterly installments through the first quarter of\n2016) of $78 million and deferred profit of $49 million (both based on the foreign currency exchange rate at the time of closing).\nRemaining quarterly installments are due through the first quarter of 2016 and will be included in other investing activities in the\nconsolidated statement of cash flows. Deferred profit is reduced and recognized into income in connection with such quarterly\ninstallments.\n \nIn addition, as discussed in Note 6, in the fourth quarter of 2014, 3M’s Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2015 dividend of $1.025\nper share (paid in March 2015), which reduced 3M’s stockholders equity and increased other current liabilities as of December 2014 by\n$648 million. In the fourth quarter of 2013, 3M’s Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2014 dividend of $0.855 per share (paid in\nMarch 2014).

See\nNote 5 “Supplemental Balance Sheet Information” for further details.\n \nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company had tax effected operating losses, capital losses, and tax credit carryovers for federal\n(approximately $31 million), state (approximately $2 million), and international (approximately $76 million), with all amounts before\nvaluation allowances. The federal tax attribute carryovers will expire after 15 to 20 years, the state after five to 10 years, and the majority of\ninternational after four years with the remaining international expiring in one year or with an indefinite carryover period. The tax attributes\nbeing carried over arise as certain jurisdictions may have tax losses or may have inabilities to utilize certain losses without the same type of\ntaxable income. As of December 31, 2015, the Company has provided $31 million of valuation allowance against certain of these deferred\ntax assets based on management’s determination that it is more-likely-than-not that the tax benefits related to these assets will not be\nrealized.\n \n74\n \nTable of Contents \nReconciliation of Effective Income Tax Rate\n \n \n    \n2015\n    \n2014\n    \n2013\n \nStatutory U.S. tax rate\n \n35.0 %  \n35.0 %  \n35.0 %\nState income taxes - net of federal benefit\n \n1.1  \n0.9  \n0.9  \nInternational income taxes - net\n \n(3.8) \n(5.8) \n(6.3) \nU.S. research and development credit\n \n(0.5) \n(0.4) \n(0.7) \nReserves for tax contingencies\n \n(1.0) \n0.6  \n1.2  \nDomestic Manufacturer’s deduction\n \n(1.8) \n(1.3) \n(1.6) \nAll other - net\n \n0.1  \n(0.1) \n(0.4) \nEffective worldwide tax rate\n \n29.1 %  \n28.9 %  \n28.1 %\n \nThe effective tax rate for 2015 was 29.1 percent, compared to 28.9 percent in 2014, an increase of 0.2 percentage points, impacted by several\nfactors. Factors which increased the Company’s effective tax rate included international taxes, which were impacted by changes in foreign\ncurrency rates and changes to the geographic mix of income before taxes, and other items. Combined, these factors increased the\nCompany’s effective tax rate by 2.4 percentage points. This increase was partially offset by a 2.2 percentage point decrease, which related to\nthe remeasurements of 3M’s uncertain tax positions, including the restoration of tax basis on certain assets for which depreciation\ndeductions were previously limited, and increases in the domestic manufacturer’s deduction and U.S. research and development credit\nbenefits.\n \nThe effective tax rate for 2014 was 28.9 percent, compared to 28.1 percent in 2013, an increase of 0.8 percentage points, impacted by many\nfactors. Factors which increased the Company’s effective tax rate included a one-time international tax impact related to the establishment\nof the supply chain center of expertise in Europe, decreased U.S. research and development credit in 2014 compared to 2013 due to two\nyears inclusion as a result of the reinstatement in 2013, decreased domestic manufacturer’s deduction, and other items. Combined, these\nfactors increased the Company’s effective tax rate by 1.6 percentage points. This increase was partially offset by a 0.8 percentage point\ndecrease, which related to both lower 3M income tax reserves for 2014 when compared to 2013 and international taxes as a result of changes\nto the geographic mix of income before taxes.\n \nThe Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various states and foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the\nCompany is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2005.\n \nThe IRS has completed its field examination of the Company’s U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 2005 through 2013. The\nCompany protested certain IRS positions within these tax years and entered into the administrative appeals process with the IRS. In\nDecember 2012, the Company received a statutory notice of deficiency for the 2006 year. The Company filed a petition in Tax Court in the\nfirst quarter of 2013 relating to the 2006 tax year. Currently, the Company is under examination by the IRS for its U.S. federal income tax\nreturns for the years 2014 and 2015. It is anticipated that the IRS will complete its examination of the Company for 2014 by the end of the\nfirst quarter of 2016 and for 2015 by the end of the first quarter of 2017. As of December 31, 2015, the IRS has not proposed any significant\nadjustments to the Company’s tax positions for which the Company is not adequately reserved.\n \nPayments relating to other proposed assessments arising from the 2005 through 2015 examinations may not be made until a final agreement\nis reached between the Company and the IRS on such assessments or upon a final resolution resulting from the administrative appeals\nprocess or judicial action. In addition to the U.S. federal examination, there is also audit activity in several U.S. state and foreign\njurisdictions.\n \n3M anticipates changes to the Company’s uncertain tax positions due to the closing and resolution of audit issues for various audit years\nmentioned above and closure of statutes. The Company is not currently able to reasonably estimate the amount by which the liability for\nunrecognized tax benefits will increase or decrease during the next 12 months as a result of the ongoing income tax authority examinations.\n \n75\n \nTable of Contents \nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits (UTB) is as follows:\n \nFederal, State and Foreign Tax\n \n(Millions)\n    \n2015\n    \n2014\n    \n2013\n \nGross UTB Balance at January 1\n $\n583  $\n659  $\n528  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nAdditions based on tax positions related to the current year\n \n \n77  \n \n201  \n \n97  \nAdditions for tax positions of prior years\n \n \n140  \n \n30  \n \n158  \nRed\n\n--------------------------------\nAnd here is your task:\n\nExtract the exact total revenue (or net sales) figure for 2014 in billions of dollars.

The ending net UTB results from adjusting the gross balance for items such\nas Federal, State, and non-U.S. deferred items, interest and penalties, and deductible taxes. The net UTB is included as components of Other\nAssets, Accrued Income Taxes, and Other Liabilities within the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n \nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in tax expense. The Company recognized in the\nconsolidated statement of income on a gross basis approximately $2 million of expense, $14 million of benefit, and $22 million of expense\nin 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. The amount of interest and penalties recognized may be an expense or benefit due to new or\nremeasured unrecognized tax benefit accruals. At December 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014, accrued interest and penalties in the\nconsolidated balance sheet on a gross basis were $45 million and $44 million, respectively. Included in these interest and penalty amounts\nare interest and penalties related to tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about\nthe timing of such deductibility. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting, other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of the\nshorter deductibility period would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority to\nan earlier period.\n \nAs a result of certain employment commitments and capital investments made by 3M, income from certain manufacturing activities in the\nfollowing countries is subject to reduced tax rates or, in some cases, is exempt from tax for years through the following: Taiwan (2015),\nChina (2016), Korea (2018), Brazil (2023), Switzerland (2024), and Singapore (2025). The income tax benefits attributable to the tax status\nof these subsidiaries are estimated to be $114 million (18 cents per diluted share) in 2015, $99 million (15 cents per diluted share) in 2014,\nand $87 million (13 cents per diluted share) in 2013.\n \nThe Company has not provided deferred taxes on unremitted earnings attributable to international companies that have been considered to\nbe reinvested indefinitely, with the exception of an acquired entity. These earnings relate to ongoing operations and were approximately $12\nbillion as of December 31, 2015. Because of the availability of U.S. foreign tax credits, the multiple avenues in which to repatriate the\nearnings to minimize tax cost, and because a large portion of these earnings are not liquid, it is not practical to determine the income tax\nliability that would be payable if such earnings were not reinvested indefinitely.\n \n76\n \nTable of Contents \n \nNOTE 9.

At December 31, 2015 and 2014, gross unrealized gains and/or losses (pre-tax) were not material. Refer to Note 6 for a table that\nprovides the net realized gains (losses) related to sales or impairments of debt and equity securities, which includes marketable securities.\nThe gross amounts of the realized gains or losses were not material. Cost of securities sold use the first in, first out (FIFO) method. Since\nthese marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale securities, changes in fair value will flow through other comprehensive\nincome, with amounts reclassified out of other comprehensive income into earnings upon sale or “other-than-temporary” impairment.\n \n3M reviews impairments associated with its marketable securities in accordance with the measurement guidance provided by ASC\n320, Investments-Debt and Equity Securities, when determining the classification of the impairment as “temporary” or “other-than-\ntemporary”. A temporary impairment charge results in an unrealized loss being recorded in the other comprehensive income component of\nshareholders’ equity. Such an unrealized loss does not reduce net income attributable to 3M for the applicable accounting period because the\nloss is not viewed as other-than-temporary. The factors evaluated to differentiate between temporary and other-than-temporary include the\nprojected future cash flows, credit ratings actions, and assessment of the credit quality of the underlying collateral, as well as other factors.\n \n77\n \nTable of Contents \nThe balance at December 31, 2015, for marketable securities by contractual maturity are shown below.

Within this portfolio, current asset-backed\nsecurities (estimated fair value of $57 million) primarily include interests in automobile loans, credit cards and equipment leases. 3M’s\ninvestment policy allows investments in asset-backed securities with minimum credit ratings of Aa2 by Moody’s Investors Service or AA\nby Standard & Poor’s or Fitch Ratings or DBRS. Asset-backed securities must be rated by at least two of the aforementioned rating\nagencies, one of which must be Moody’s Investors Service or Standard & Poor’s. At December 31, 2015, all asset-backed security\ninvestments were in compliance with this policy. Approximately 75.8 percent of all asset-backed security investments were rated AAA or A-\n1+ by Standard & Poor’s and/or Aaa or P-1 by Moody’s Investors Service and/or AAA or F1+ by Fitch Ratings. Interest rate risk and credit\nrisk related to the underlying collateral may impact the value of investments in asset-backed securities, while factors such as general\nconditions in the overall credit market and the nature of the underlying collateral may affect the liquidity of investments in asset-backed\nsecurities. 3M does not currently expect risk related to its holding in asset-backed securities to materially impact its financial condition or\nliquidity.\n \n \n78\n \nTable of Contents \nNOTE 10.

This credit agreement includes a provision under which 3M may request an increase of up to $2.25 billion,\nbringing the total facility up to $4.5 billion (at the lender’s discretion). This facility was undrawn at December 31, 2015. Under the $2.25\nbillion credit agreement, the Company is required to maintain its EBITDA to Interest Ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter at not less\nthan 3.0 to 1. This is calculated (as defined in the agreement) as the ratio of consolidated total EBITDA for the four consecutive quarters\nthen ended to total interest expense on all funded debt for the same period. At December 31, 2015, this ratio was approximately 56 to 1. Debt\ncovenants do not restrict the payment of dividends.\n \nOther Credit Facilities\n \nApart from the committed revolving facility, an additional $241 million in stand-alone letters of credit and $18 million in bank guarantees\nwere also issued and outstanding at December 31, 2015. These lines of credit are utilized in connection with normal business activities.\n \nLong-Term Debt Issuances\n \nThe principal amounts, interest rates and maturity dates of individual long-term debt issuances can be found in the long-term debt table\nfound at the beginning of this note.\n \nIn May 2015, 3M issued 1.750 billion Euros aggregate principal amount of medium term notes. In August 2015, 3M issued $1.500 billion\naggregate principal amount of medium-term notes. Upon debt issuance, the Company entered into two interest rate swaps as fair value\nhedges of a portion of the fixed interest rate medium-term note obligation. The first converted a $450 million three-year fixed rate note, and\nthe second converted $300 million of a five-year fixed rate note included in this issuance to an interest rate based on a floating three-month\nLIBOR index.\n \nIn June 2014, 3M issued $950 million aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes. Upon debt issuance, the Company entered into an\ninterest rate swap to convert $600 million of a $625 million note included in this issuance to an interest rate based on a floating three-month\nLIBOR index as a fair value hedge of a portion of the fixed interest rate medium-term note obligation. In November 2014, the Company\nissued 1.250 billion Euros aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes.\n \nIn November 2013, 3M issued a Eurobond for an amount of 600 million Euros. Upon debt issuance, 3M completed a fixed-to-floating\ninterest rate swap on a notional amount of 300 million Euros.\n \n80\n \nTable of Contents \nLong-Term Debt Maturities\n \nIn July 2014, 3M retired at maturity 1.025 billion Euros of seven-year 5.0% fixed rate Eurobonds. In December 2012, 3M entered into a\nthree-year 66 million British Pound (approximately $106 million based on agreement date exchange rates) committed credit facility\nagreement with JP Morgan Chase Bank, which was fully drawn as of December 31, 2012. 3M repaid the balance in 2014.\n \nIn August 2013, 3M repaid $850 million (principal amount) of medium-term notes.\n \nFloating Rate Notes\n \nAt various times, 3M has issued floating rate notes containing put provisions. 3M would be required to repurchase these securities at\nvarious prices ranging from 99 percent to 100 percent of par value according to the reduction schedules for each security. In December 2004,\n3M issued a forty-year $60 million floating rate note, with a rate based on a floating LIBOR index. Under the terms of this floating rate note\ndue in 2044, holders have an annual put feature at 100 percent of par value from 2014 and every anniversary thereafter until final maturity.\nUnder the terms of the floating rate notes due in 2027, 2040 and 2041, holders have put options that commence ten years from the date of\nissuance and each third anniversary thereafter until final maturity at prices ranging from 99 percent to 100 percent of par value. In 2008\nthrough 2015, 3M was required to repurchase an immaterial amount of principal on the aforementioned floating rate notes.\n \n NOTE 11.  Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans\n \n3M has company-sponsored retirement plans covering substantially all U.S. employees and many employees outside the United States. In\ntotal, 3M has over 80 defined benefit plans in 28 countries. Pension benefits associated with these plans generally are based on each\nparticipant’s years of service, compensation, and age at retirement or termination. The primary U.S. defined-benefit pension plan was closed\nto new participants effective January 1, 2009. The Company also provides certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for\nsubstantially all of its U.S. employees who reach retirement age while employed by the Company. Most international employees and\nretirees are covered by government health care programs. The cost of company-provided postretirement health care plans for international\nemployees is not material and is combined with U.S. amounts in the tables that follow.\n \nThe Company also sponsors employee savings plans under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. These plans are offered to\nsubstantially all regular U.S. employees. For eligible employees hired prior to January 1, 2009, employee 401(k) contributions of up to 6%\nof eligible compensation were matched in cash at rates of 60% or 75%, depending on the plan in which the employee participates.\nEmployees hired on or after January 1, 2009, received a cash match of 100% for employee 401(k) contributions of up to 6% of eligible\ncompensation and also received an employer retirement income account cash contribution of 3% of the participant’s total eligible\ncompensation. Beginning on January 1, 2016, for U.S. employees, the Company reduced its match on employee 401(k) contributions. For\neligible employees hired prior to January 1, 2009, employee 401(k) contributions of up to 5% of eligible compensation will be matched in\ncash at rates of 45% or 60%, depending on the plan in which the employee participates. Employees hired on or after January 1, 2009, will\nreceive a cash match of 100% for employee 401(k) contributions of up to 5% of eligible compensation and will also continue to receive an\nemployer retirement income account cash contribution of 3% of the participant’s total eligible compensation. All contributions are invested\nin a number of investment funds pursuant to the employees’ elections. Employer contributions to the U.S. defined contribution plans were\n$165 million, $153 million and $136 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 3M subsidiaries in various international countries also\nparticipate in defined contribution plans. Employer contributions to the international defined contribution plans were $77 million, $75\nmillion and $71 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\n \nThe Company has made deposits for its defined benefit plans with independent trustees. Trust funds and deposits with insurance companies\nare maintained to provide pension benefits to plan participants and their beneficiaries. There are no plan assets in the non-qualified plan due\nto its nature. For its U.S. postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans, the Company has set aside amounts at least equal to\nannual benefit payments with an independent trustee.\n \n81\n \nTable of Contents \n3M’s primary U.S. qualified defined benefit plan does not have a mandatory cash contribution because the Company has a significant credit\nbalance from previous discretionary contributions that can be applied to any Pension Protection Act funding requirements.\n \nAs a result o\n\n--------------------------------\nAnd here is your task:\n\nExtract the exact total revenue (or net sales) figure for 2014 in billions of dollars.

These changes became effective beginning January 1, 2013, for all Medicare eligible\nretirees and their Medicare eligible dependents and became effective beginning January 1, 2016, for all non-Medicare eligible retirees and\ntheir eligible dependents. In August 2015, 3M modified the 3M Retiree Welfare Benefit Plan postretirement medical benefit reducing the\nfuture benefit for participants not retired as of January 1, 2016. For participants retiring after January 1, 2016, the Retiree Medical Savings\nAccount (RMSA) is no longer credited with interest and the indexation on both the RMSA and the Medicare Health Reimbursement\nArrangement is reduced from 3 percent to 1.5 percent per year (for those employees who are eligible for these accounts). Also effective\nJanuary 1, 2016, 3M no longer offers 3M Retiree Health Care Accounts to new hires. Due to these changes the plan was re-measured in the\nthird quarter of 2015, resulting in a decrease to the projected benefit obligation liability of approximately $233 million, and a related\nincrease to shareholders’ equity, specifically accumulated other comprehensive income.\n \nIn the third quarter of 2014, former U.S. employees who have a pension benefit for which they have not begun receiving payment (term\nvested) were offered a lump sum payout of their pension benefit. As a result of this action, the projected benefit obligation (PBO) liability\nwas reduced in the fourth quarter of 2014 by approximately $270 million, with the actual cash payout of approximately the same amount\npaid from the plan’s assets in the fourth quarter of 2014. The PBO liability reduction was 34% of the term vested eligible PBO and a 2%\nreduction in the overall U.S. pension PBO liability based on the December 31, 2013, valuation. There was no pension expense impact as a\nresult of this action on 3M’s consolidated statement of income in 2014.\n \nIn the fourth quarter of 2014, 3M’s Board of Directors approved an amendment of the U.S. defined benefit pension plan to include a lump\nsum payment option for employees that have vested retirement benefits who commence their pension January 1, 2015, or later. This option\nis also available to vested employees who leave 3M before becoming eligible to retire at the time of termination. This change reduced 3M’s\nyear-end 2014 U.S. pension PBO liability by approximately $266 million.\n \nAs of December 31, 2014, the Company converted to the “RP 2014 Mortality Tables” and updated the mortality improvement scale it used\nfor calculating the year-end 2014 U.S. defined benefit pension annuitant and postretirement obligations and 2015 expense. The impact of\nthis change increased the year-end 2014 U.S. pension PBO by approximately $820 million and the U.S. accumulated postretirement benefit\nobligation by approximately $100 million.\n \nIn March 2015, 3M Japan modified the Japan Limited Defined Benefit Corporate Pension Plan (DBCPP). Beginning July 1, 2015, eligible\nemployees receive a company provided contribution match of 6.12% of their eligible salary to their defined contribution plan. Employees no\nlonger earn additional service towards their defined benefit pension plans after July 1, 2015, except for eligible salaries above the statutory\ndefined contribution limits. As a result of this plan modification, the Company re-measured the DBCPP, which resulted in a $17 million\npre-tax curtailment gain for the year ending December 31, 2015. In March 2015, 3M also received a favorable Internal Revenue Service tax\ndetermination letter to terminate a frozen defined benefit pension plan of one of 3M’s acquired subsidiaries. By the end of 2015, this plan\nmade final distributions of $16 million to participants. The Company also had other settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits\nand other items in 2015 aggregating to the amounts indicated in these components in the applicable tables that follow.\n \n3M was informed during the first quarter of 2009, that the general partners of WG Trading Company, in which 3M’s benefit plans hold\nlimited partnership interests, are the subject of a criminal investigation as well as civil proceedings by the SEC and CFTC (Commodity\nFutures Trading Commission). In March 2011, over the objections of 3M and six other limited partners of WG Trading Company, the\ndistrict court judge ruled in favor of the court appointed receiver’s proposed distribution plan (and in April 2013, the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the district court’s ruling). The benefit plan trustee holdings of WG Trading Company interests\nwere adjusted to reflect the decreased estimated fair market value, inclusive of estimated insurance proceeds, as of the annual measurement\ndates.\n82\n \nTable of Contents \nThe Company has insurance that it believes, based on what is currently known, will result in the probable recovery of a portion of the\ndecrease in original asset value. In the first quarter of 2014, 3M and certain 3M benefit plans filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the\nDistrict of Minnesota against five insurers seeking insurance coverage for the WG Trading Company claim. In September 2015, the court\nruled in favor of the defendant insurance companies on a motion for summary judgment and dismissed the lawsuit. In October 2015, 3M and\nthe 3M benefit plans filed a notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. As of the 2015 measurement date,\nthese holdings represented less than one half of one percent of 3M’s fair value of total plan assets. 3M currently believes that the resolution\nof these events will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of the Company.\n \nThe following tables include a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets\nas well as a summary of the related amounts recognized in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31 of the respective\nyears. 3M also has certain non-qualified unfunded pension and postretirement benefit plans, inclusive of plans related to supplement/excess\nbenefits for employees impacted by particular relocations and other matters, that individually and in the aggregate are not significant and\nwhich are not included in the tables that follow. The obligations for these plans are included within other liabilities in the Company’s\nconsolidated balance sheet and aggregated less than $35 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.\n \n \n \nQualified and Non-qualified\n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nPension Benefits\n \nPostretirement\n \n \n \nUnited States\n \nInternational\n \nBenefits\n \n(Millions)\n    \n2015\n    \n2014\n    \n2015\n    \n2014\n    \n2015\n    \n2014\n \nChange in benefit obligation\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nBenefit obligation at beginning of year\n $\n16,452  $\n13,967  $\n6,979  $\n6,346  $\n2,462  $\n2,017  \nAcquisitions/Transfers in\n  \n —   \n —   \n94   \n —   \n —   \n —  \nService cost\n  \n293   \n241   \n154   \n141   \n75   \n65  \nInterest cost\n  \n655   \n676   \n206   \n252   \n98   \n97  \nParticipant contributions\n  \n —   \n —   \n9   \n10   \n14   \n18  \nForeign exchange rate changes\n  \n —   \n —   \n(589)  \n(663)  \n(22)  \n(11) \nPlan amendments\n  \n —   \n(266)  \n(6)  \n3   \n(211)  \n —  \nActuarial (gain) loss\n  \n(657)  \n2,874   \n(274)  \n1,128   \n(80)  \n415  \nMedicare Part D Reimbursement\n  \n —   \n —   \n —   \n —   \n1   \n1  \nBenefit payments\n  \n(874)  \n(1,039)  \n(232)  \n(235)  \n(122)  \n(140) \nSettlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and\nother\n  \n(13)  \n(1)  \n(19)  \n(3)  \n1   \n —  \nBenefit obligation at end of year\n $\n15,856  $\n16,452  $\n6,322  $\n6,979  $\n2,216  $\n2,462  \nChange in plan assets\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nFair value of plan assets at beginning of year\n $\n14,643  $\n13,889  $\n5,957  $\n5,758  $\n1,436  $\n1,405  \nAcquisitions/Transfers in\n  \n —   \n —   \n8   \n —   \n —   \n —  \nActual return on plan assets\n  \n100   \n1,749   \n287   \n813   \n36   \n148  \nCompany contributions\n  \n113   \n45   \n151   \n165   \n3   \n5  \nParticipant contributions\n  \n —   \n —   \n9   \n10   \n14   \n18  \nForeign exchange rate changes\n  \n —   \n —   \n(498)  \n(554)  \n —   \n —  \nBenefit payments\n  \n(874)  \n(1,039)  \n(232)  \n(235)  \n(122)  \n(140) \nSettlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and\nother\n  \n(16)  \n(1)  \n(13)  \n —   \n —   \n —  \nFair value of plan assets at end of year\n $\n13,966  $\n14,643  $\n5,669  $\n5,957  $\n1,367  $\n1,436  \nFunded status at end of year\n $\n(1,890) $\n(1,809) $\n(653) $\n(1,022) $\n(849) $\n(1,026) \n \n83\n \nTable of Contents \n \n \nQualified and Non-qualified\n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nPension Benefits\n \nPostretirement\n \n \n \nUnited States\n \nInternational\n \nBenefits\n \n(Millions)\n    \n2015\n    \n2014\n    \n2015\n    \n2014\n    \n2015\n    \n2014\n \nAmounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as\nof Dec. 31,\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nNon-current assets\n $\n3  $\n3  $\n185  $\n43  $\n —  $\n —  \nAccrued benefit cost\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nCurrent liabilities\n  \n(47)  \n(46)  \n(10)  \n(10)  \n(3)  \n(4) \nNon-current liabilities\n  \n(1,846)  \n(1,766)  \n(828)  \n(1,055)  \n(846)  \n(1,022) \nEnding balance\n $\n(1,890) $\n(1,809) $\n(653) $\n(1,022) $\n(849) $\n(1,026) \n \n \n \nQualified and Non-qualified\n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nPension Benefits\n \nPostretirement\n \n \n \nUnited States\n \nInternational\n \nBenefits\n \n(Millions)\n    \n2015\n    \n2014\n    \n2015\n    \n2014\n    \n2015\n    \n2014\n \nAmounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive\nincome as of Dec. 31,\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nNet transition obligation (asset)\n $\n —  $\n —  $\n(2) $\n(3) $\n —  $\n —  \nNet actuarial loss (gain)\n  \n5,366   \n5,462   \n1,610   \n2,200   \n815   \n914  \nPrior service cost (credit)\n  \n(227)  \n(251)  \n(68)  \n(93)  \n(270)  \n(102) \nEnding balance\n $\n5,139  $\n5,211  $\n1,540  $\n2,104  $\n545  $\n812  \n \nThe balance of amounts recognized for international p\n\n--------------------------------\nAnd here is your task:\n\nExtract the exact total revenue (or net sales) figure for 2014 in billions of dollars.

transitioning all current and future retirees in the U.S. postretirement health care benefit plans to a savings\naccount benefits-based plan. The contributions provided by the Company to the health savings accounts increase 3 percent per year for\nemployees who retired prior to January 1, 2016 and increase 1.5 percent for employees who retire on or after January 1, 2016. Therefore,\nthe Company no longer has material exposure to health care cost inflation.\n \nThe Company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the December 31 measurement date for the pension and\npostretirement benefit plans, which is also the date used for the related annual measurement assumptions. The discount rate reflects the\ncurrent rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. The Company sets its rate to reflect the\nyield of a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle\nprojected future benefits. Using this methodology, the Company determined a discount rate of 4.47% for pension and 4.48% for\npostretirement benefits to be appropriate for its U.S. plans as of December 31, 2015, which is an increase of 0.37 percentage points and 0.41\npercentage points, respectively, from the rates used as of December 31, 2014. For the international pension and postretirement plans the\ndiscount rates also reflect the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. If the country\nhas a deep market in corporate bonds the Company matches the expected cash flows from the plan either to a portfolio of bonds that\ngenerate sufficient cash flow or a notional yield curve generated from available bond information. In countries that do not have a deep\nmarket in corporate bonds, government bonds are considered with a risk premium to approximate corporate bond yields. Beginning in 2016,\n3M changed the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic pension and other postretirement\nbenefit costs. The new method measures service and interest costs separately using the spot yield curve approach applied to each\ncorresponding obligation. Service costs are determined based on duration-specific spot rates applied to the service cost cash flows. The\ninterest cost calculation is determined by applying duration-specific spot rates to the year-by-year projected benefit payments. The spot yield\ncurve approach does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest costs offset in the\nactuarial gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income. The Company changed to the new method to provide a more precise\nmeasure of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between the projected benefit cash flows and the discrete spot yield curve\nrates. The Company accounted for this change as a change in estimate prospectively beginning in the first quarter of 2016.\n \nFor the primary U.S. qualified pension plan, the Company’s assumption for the expected return on plan assets was 7.75% in 2015. Projected\nreturns are based primarily on broad, publicly traded equity and fixed-income indices and forward-looking estimates of active portfolio and\ninvestment management. As of December 31, 2015, the Company’s 2016 expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets is 7.50%, a\ndecrease of 0.25 percentage points from 2015. The expected return assumption is based on the strategic asset allocation of the plan, long\nterm capital market return expectations and expected performance from active investment management.

In 2014 the plan earned a rate of return of 13.0% and in 2013 earned a return\nof 6.0%. The average annual actual return on the plan assets over the past 10 and 25 years has been 7.8% and 10.0%, respectively. Return on\nassets assumptions for international pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are calculated on a plan-by-plan basis using plan asset\nallocations and expected long-term rate of return assumptions.\n \nDuring 2015, the Company contributed $264 million to its U.S. and international pension plans and $3 million to its postretirement plans.\nDuring 2014, the Company contributed $210 million to its U.S. and international pension plans and $5 million to its postretirement plans. In\n2016, the Company expects to contribute an amount in the range of $100 million to $200 million of cash to its U.S. and international\nretirement plans. The Company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2016.

The primary goal of the\ntrust funds is to meet the obligations as required. The secondary goal is to earn the highest rate of return possible, without jeopardizing its\nprimary goal, and without subjecting the Company to an undue amount of contribution risk. Fund returns are used to help finance present\nand future obligations to the extent possible within actuarially determined funding limits and tax-determined asset limits, thus reducing the\npotential need for additional contributions from 3M. The investment strategy has used long duration cash bonds and derivative instruments\nto offset a significant portion of the interest rate sensitivity of U.S. pension liabilities.\n \nNormally, 3M does not buy or sell any of its own securities as a direct investment for its pension and other postretirement benefit funds.\nHowever, due to external investment management of the funds, the plans may indirectly buy, sell or hold 3M securities. The aggregate\namount of 3M securities are not considered to be material relative to the aggregate fund percentages.\n \nThe discussion that follows references the fair value measurements of certain assets in terms of levels 1, 2 and 3. See Note 13 for\ndescriptions of these levels. While the company believes the valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market\nparticipants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a\ndifferent estimate of fair value at the reporting date.\n \n87\n \nTable of Contents \nU.S. Pension Plans and Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets\n \nIn order to achieve the investment objectives in the U.S. pension plans and U.S. postretirement benefit plans, the investment policies include\na target strategic asset allocation. The investment policies allow some tolerance around the target in recognition that market fluctuations and\nilliquidity of some investments may cause the allocation to a specific asset class to vary from the target allocation, potentially for long\nperiods of time. Acceptable ranges have been designed to allow for deviation from strategic targets and to allow for the opportunity for\ntactical over- and under-weights. The portfolios will normally be rebalanced when the quarter-end asset allocation deviates from acceptable\nranges. The allocation is reviewed regularly by the named fiduciary of the plans.  Approximately 39% of the postretirement benefit plan\nassets are in a 401(h) account.

Beginning in the second quarter of 2014, 3M began\nextending the maximum length of time over which it hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows of the forecasted transactions\nfrom a previous term of 12 months to a longer term of 24 months, with certain currencies being extended further to 36 months starting in the\nfirst quarter of 2015.\n \nCash Flow Hedging - Commodity Price Management: The Company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts,\nprice protection agreements and forward contracts. 3M discontinued the use of commodity price swaps as cash flow hedges of forecasted\ncommodity transactions in the first quarter of 2015. The Company used commodity price swaps as cash flow hedges of forecasted\ncommodity transactions to manage price volatility. The related mark-to-market gain or loss on qualifying hedges was included in other\ncomprehensive income to the extent effective, and reclassified into cost of sales in the period during which the hedged transaction affected\nearnings.\n \nCash Flow Hedging — Interest Rate Contracts: In the third and fourth quarters of 2014, the Company entered into forward starting interest\nrate swaps with notional amounts totaling 500 million Euros as a hedge against interest rate volatility associated with the forecasted issuance\nof fixed rate debt. 3M terminated these interest rate swaps upon issuance of 750 million Euros aggregate principal amount of twelve-year\nfixed rate notes in connection with 3M’s 1.250 billion Eurobond offering in November 2014. The termination resulted in a $8 million pre-\ntax ($5 million after-tax) loss within accumulated other comprehensive income that will be amortized over the twelve-year life of the notes.\n \nThe amortization of gains and losses on forward starting interest rate swaps is included in the tables below as part of the gain/(loss)\nrecognized in income on the effective portion of derivatives as a result of reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income.\n \nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company had a balance of $124 million associated with the after tax net unrealized gain associated with cash\nflow hedging instruments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. This includes a remaining balance of $5 million (after tax\nloss) related to forward starting interest rate swaps, which will be amortized over the respective lives of the notes. Based on exchange rates\nas of December 31, 2015, 3M expects to reclassify approximately $98 million of the after-tax net unrealized foreign exchange cash flow\nhedging gains to earnings in 2016, approximately $23 million of the after-tax net unrealized foreign exchange cash flow hedging gains to\nearnings in 2017, and approximately $3 million of the after-tax net unrealized foreign exchange cash flow hedging gains to earnings after\n2017 (with the impact offset by earnings/losses from underlying hedged items).\n \nThe location in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and amounts of gains and losses related to derivative\ninstruments designated as cash flow hedges are provided in the following table. Reclassifications of amounts from accumulated other\ncomprehensive income into income include accumulated gains (losses) on dedesignated hedges at the time earnings are impacted by the\nforecasted transaction.\n92\n \nTable of Contents \nYear Ended December 31, 2015\n \n \n \n \n \nPretax Gain (Loss) Recognized in\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nPretax Gain (Loss)\n \nIncome on Effective Portion of\n \nIneffective Portion of Gain\n \n \n \nRecognized in Other\n \nDerivative as a Result of\n \n(Loss) on Derivative and\n \n \n \nComprehensive\n \nReclassification from\n \nAmount Excluded from\n \n \n \nIncome on Effective\n \nAccumulated Other\n \nEffectiveness Testing\n \n(Millions)\n \nPortion of Derivative\n \nComprehensive Income\n \nRecognized in Income\n \nDerivatives in Cash Flow Hedging Relationships\n    \nAmount\n    \nLocation\n    \nAmount\n    \nLocation\n    \nAmount\n \nForeign currency forward/option contracts\n $\n212  \nCost of sales\n \n$\n178  \nCost of sales\n $\n—  \nCommodity price swap contracts\n \n \n —  \nCost of sales\n \n \n(2) \nCost of sales\n \n \n—  \nInterest rate swap contracts\n \n \n—  \nInterest expense\n \n \n(2) \nInterest expense\n \n \n—  \nTotal\n $\n212  \n  \n$\n174  \n  $\n —  \n \nYear Ended December 31, 2014\n \n \n \n \n \nPretax Gain (Loss) Recognized in\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nPretax Gain (Loss)\n \nIncome on Effective Portion of\n \nIneffective Portion of Gain\n \n \n \nRecognized in Other\n \nDerivative as a Result of\n \n(Loss) on Derivative and\n \n \n \nComprehensive\n \nReclassification from\n \nAmount Excluded from\n \n \n \nIncome on Effective\n \nAccumulated Other\n \nEffectiveness Testing\n \n(Millions)\n \nPortion of Derivative\n \nComprehensive Income\n \nRecognized in Income\n \nDerivatives in Cash Flow Hedging Relationships\n    \nAmount\n    \nLocation\n    \nAmount\n    \nLocation\n    \nAmount\n \nForeign currency forward/option contracts\n $\n183  \nCost of sales\n \n$\n3  \nCost of sales\n $\n—  \nCommodity price swap contracts\n \n \n(4) \nCost of sales\n \n \n2  \nCost of sales\n \n \n—  \nInterest rate swap contracts\n \n \n(8) \nInterest expense\n \n \n(1) \nInterest expense\n \n \n—  \nTotal\n $\n171   \n \n$\n4   \n $\n —  \n \nYear Ended December 31, 2013\n \n  \n \n \nPretax Gain (Loss) Recognized in\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nPretax Gain (Loss)\n \nIncome on Effective Portion of\n \nIneffective Portion of Gain\n \n \n \nRecognized in Other\n \nDerivative as a Result of\n \n(Loss) on Derivative and\n \n \n \nComprehensive\n \nReclassification from\n \nAmount Excluded from\n \n \n \nIncome on Effective\n \nAccumulated Other\n \nEffectiveness Testing\n \n(Millions)\n \nPortion of Derivative\n \nComprehensive Income\n \nRecognized in Income\n \nDerivatives in Cash Flow Hedging Relationships\n    \nAmount\n    \nLocation\n    \nAmount\n    \nLocation\n    \nAmount\n \nForeign currency forward/option contracts\n $\n9  \nCost of sales\n \n$\n(11) \nCost of sales\n $\n—  \nForeign currency forward contracts\n \n \n(108) \nInterest expense\n \n \n(108) \nInterest expense\n \n \n—  \nCommodity price swap contracts\n \n \n1  \nCost of sales\n \n \n(2) \nCost of sales\n \n \n—  \nInterest rate swap contracts\n \n \n —  \nInterest expense\n \n \n(1) \nInterest expense\n \n \n—  \nTotal\n $\n(98)  \n \n$\n(122)  \n $\n —  \n \nFair Value Hedges:\n \nFor derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivatives as well as the offsetting\nloss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current earnings.\n \nFair Value Hedging - Interest Rate Swaps: The Company manages interest expense using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. To help\nmanage borrowing costs, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps. Under these arrangements, the Company agrees to exchange, at\nspecified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal\namount. The mark-to-market of these fair value hedges is recorded as gains or losses in interest expense and is offset by the gain or loss of\nthe underlying debt instrument, which also is recorded in interest expense. These fair value hedges are highly effective and, thus, there is no\nimpact on earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness.\n \nIn July 2007, in connection with the issuance of a seven-year Eurobond for an amount of 750 million Euros, the Company completed a\nfixed-to-floating interest rate swap on a notional amount of 400 million Euros as a fair value hedge of a portion of the fixed interest rate\nEurobond obligation. In August 2010, the Company terminated 150 million Euros of the notional amount of this swap. As a result, a gain of\n18 million Euros, recorded as part of the balance of the underlying debt, was amortized as an offset to interest expense over this debt’s\nremaining life.

The remaining interest rate swap of 250 million Euros (notional amount) matured in\nJuly 2014.\n \n93\n \nTable of Contents \nIn November 2013, 3M issued a Eurobond due in 2021 for a face amount of 600 million Euros. Upon debt issuance, 3M completed a fixed-\nto-floating interest rate swap on a notional amount of 300 million Euros as a fair value hedge of a portion of the fixed interest rate Eurobond\nobligation.\n \nIn June 2014, 3M issued $950 million aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes. Upon debt issuance, the Company entered into an\ninterest rate swap to convert $600 million of a $625 million note included in this issuance to an interest rate based on a floating three-month\nLIBOR index as a fair value hedge of a portion of the fixed interest rate medium-term note obligation.\n \nIn August 2015, 3M issued $1.500 billion aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes. Upon debt issuance, the Company entered into\ntwo interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of a portion of the fixed interest rate medium-term note obligation.

For instruments that are\ndesignated and qualify as hedges of net investments in foreign operations and that meet the effectiveness requirements, the net gains or\nlosses attributable to changes in spot exchange rates are recorded in cumulative translation within other comprehensive income. The\nremainder of the change in value of such instruments is recorded in earnings. Recognition in earnings of amounts previously recorded in\ncumulative translation is limited to circumstances such as complete or substantially complete liquidation of the net investment in the hedged\nforeign operation. To the extent foreign currency denominated debt is not designated in or is dedesignated from a net investment hedge\nrelationship, changes in value of that portion of foreign currency denominated debt due to exchange rate changes are recorded in earnings\nthrough their maturity date.\n \n3M’s use of foreign exchange forward contracts designated in hedges of the Company’s net investment in foreign subsidiaries can vary by\ntime period depending on when foreign currency denominated debt balances designated in such relationships are dedesignated, matured, or\nare newly issued and designated. Additionally, variation can occur in connection with the extent of the Company’s desired foreign exchange\nrisk coverage.\n \nAt December 31, 2015, the total notional amount of foreign exchange forward contracts designated in net investment hedges was\napproximately 974 million Euros and approximately 248 billion South Korean Won, along with a principal\n94\n \nTable of Contents \namount of long-term debt instruments designated in net investment hedges totaling 3.6 billion Euros.

However, the Company’s risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments. The Company\nactively monitors its exposure to credit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit limits, and by selecting major international banks\nand financial institutions as counterparties. 3M enters into master netting arrangements with counterparties when possible to mitigate credit\nrisk in derivative transactions. A master netting arrangement may allow each counterparty to net settle amounts owed between a 3M entity\nand the counterparty as a result of multiple, separate derivative transactions. As of December 31, 2015, 3M has International Swaps and\nDerivatives Association (ISDA) agreements with 16 applicable banks and financial institutions which contain netting provisions. In\naddition to a master agreement with 3M supported by a primary counterparty’s parent guarantee, 3M also has associated credit support\nagreements in place with 15 of its primary derivative counterparties which, among other things, provide the circumstances under which\neither party is required to post eligible collateral (when the market value of transactions covered by these agreements exceeds specified\nthresholds or if a counterparty’s credit rating has been downgraded to a predetermined rating). The Company does not anticipate\nnonperformance by any of these counterparties.\n \n3M has elected to present the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities within the Company’s consolidated balance sheet on a gross basis\neven when derivative transactions are subject to master netting arrangements and may otherwise qualify for net presentation. However, the\nfollowing tables provide information as if the Company had elected to offset the asset and liability balances of derivative instruments, netted\nin accordance with various criteria in the event of default or termination as stipulated by the terms of netting arrangements with each of the\ncounterparties.

Fair Value Measurements\n \n3M follows ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, with respect to assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a\nrecurring basis and nonrecurring basis. Under the standard, fair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount that would be received to\nsell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. The standard\nalso establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of\nunobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs market participants\nwould use in valuing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company.\nUnobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions about the factors market participants would use in valuing the asset\nor liability developed based upon the best information available in the circumstances. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels. Level\n1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar\nassets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs (other\nthan quoted prices) that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the\nasset or liability. Categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value\nmeasurement.\n \nAssets and Liabilities that are Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis:\n \nFor 3M, assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis primarily relate to available-for-sale marketable securities,\navailable-for-sale investments (included as part of investments in the Consolidated Balance Sheet) and certain derivative instruments.\nDerivatives include cash flow hedges, interest rate swaps and most net investment hedges. The information in the following paragraphs and\ntables primarily addresses matters relative to these financial assets and liabilities.

Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the respective financial assets and liabilities measured at\nfair value.\n \nAvailable-for-sale marketable securities — except certain U.S. municipal securities:\n \nMarketable securities, except certain U.S. municipal securities, are valued utilizing multiple sources. A weighted average price is used for\nthese securities. Market prices are obtained for these securities from a variety of industry standard data providers, security master files from\nlarge financial institutions, and other third-party sources. These multiple prices are used as inputs into a distribution-curve-based algorithm\nto determine the daily fair value to be used. 3M classifies U.S. treasury securities as level 1, while all other marketable securities (excluding\ncertain U.S. municipal securities) are classified as level 2. Marketable securities are discussed further in Note 9.\n \nAvailable-for-sale marketable securities —certain U.S. municipal securities only:\n \nIn the fourth quarter 2014, 3M obtained a municipal bond with the City of Nevada, Missouri, which represent 3M’s only U.S. municipal\nsecurities holding as of December 31, 2015. Due to the nature of this security, the valuation method utilized will include the financial health\nof the City of Nevada, any recent municipal bond issuances by Nevada, and macroeconomic considerations related to the direction of\ninterest rates and the health of the overall municipal bond market, and as such will be classified as a level 3 security.\n \nAvailable-for-sale investments:\n \nInvestments include equity securities that are traded in an active market. Closing stock prices are readily available from active markets and\nare used as being representative of fair value. 3M classifies these securities as level 1.\n \nDerivative instruments:\n \nThe Company’s derivative assets and liabilities within the scope of ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, are required to be recorded at fair\nvalue. The Company’s derivatives that are recorded at fair value include foreign currency forward and option contracts, commodity price\nswaps, interest rate swaps, and net investment hedges where the hedging instrument is recorded at fair value. Net investment hedges that use\nforeign currency denominated debt to hedge 3M’s net investment are not impacted by the fair value measurement standard under ASC 820,\nas the debt used as the hedging instrument is marked to a value with respect to changes in spot foreign currency exchange rates and not with\nrespect to other factors that may impact fair value.\n \n3M has determined that foreign currency forwards, commodity price swaps, currency swaps, foreign currency options, interest rate swaps\nand cross-currency swaps will be considered level 2 measurements. 3M uses inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the\nasset. These inputs include foreign currency exchange rates, volatilities, and interest rates. Derivative positions are primarily valued using\nstandard calculations/models that use as their basis readily observable market parameters. Industry standard data providers are 3M’s primary\nsource for forward and spot rate information for both interest rates and currency rates, with resulting valuations periodically validated\nthrough third-party or counterparty quotes and a net present value stream of cash flows model.\n \n99\n \nTable of Contents \nThe following tables provide information by level for assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis.\n \n  \n \n \nFair Value Measurements\n \n(Millions)\n \nFair Value at\n \nUsing Inputs Considered as\n \nDescription\n    December 31, 2015     \nLevel 1\n    \nLevel 2\n    \nLevel 3\n \nAssets:\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nAvailable-for-sale:\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nMarketable securities:\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nForeign government agency securities\n $\n10  $\n —  $\n10  $\n —  \nCorporate debt securities\n \n \n10   \n —   \n10   \n —  \nCommercial paper\n \n \n12  \n \n —  \n \n12  \n \n —  \nCertificates of deposit/time deposits\n \n \n26   \n —   \n26   \n —  \nAsset-backed securities:\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nAutomobile loan related\n \n \n26   \n —   \n26   \n —  \nCredit card related\n \n \n10   \n —   \n10   \n —  \nEquipment lease related\n \n \n2   \n —   \n2   \n —  \nOther\n \n \n19   \n —   \n19   \n —  \nU.S. municipal securities\n \n \n12   \n —   \n —   \n12  \nDerivative instruments — assets:\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nForeign currency forward/option contracts\n \n \n272   \n —   \n272   \n —  \nInterest rate swap contracts\n \n \n24   \n —   \n24   \n —  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nLiabilities:\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nDerivative instruments — liabilities:\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nForeign currency forward/option contracts\n \n \n68   \n —   \n68   \n —  \nInterest rate swap contracts\n \n \n1   \n —   \n1   \n —  \n \n \n  \n \n \nFair Value Measurements\n \n(Millions)\n \nFair Value at\n \nUsing Inputs Considered as\n \nDescription\n    December 31, 2014     \nLevel 1\n    \nLevel 2\n    \nLevel 3\n \nAssets:\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nAvailable-for-sale:\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nMarketable securities:\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nU.S. government agency securities\n $\n108  $\n —  $\n108  $\n —  \nForeign government agency securities\n \n \n95   \n —   \n95   \n —  \nCorporate debt securities\n \n \n619   \n —   \n619   \n —  \nCertificates of deposit/time deposits\n \n \n41   \n —   \n41   \n —  \nAsset-backed securities:\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nAutomobile loan related\n \n \n282   \n —   \n282   \n —  \nCredit card related\n \n \n162   \n —   \n162   \n —  \nEquipment lease related\n \n \n48   \n —   \n48   \n —  \nOther\n \n \n46   \n —   \n46   \n —  \nU.S. treasury securities\n \n \n38   \n38   \n —   \n —  \nU.S. municipal securities\n \n \n15   \n —   \n —   \n15  \nInvestments\n \n \n1   \n1   \n —   \n —  \nDerivative instruments — assets:\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nForeign currency forward/option contracts\n \n \n229   \n —   \n229   \n —  \nInterest rate swap contracts\n \n \n27   \n —   \n27   \n —  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nLiabilities:\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nDerivative instruments — liabilities:\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nForeign currency forward/option contracts\n \n \n36   \n —   \n36   \n —  \nCommodity price swap contracts\n \n \n4  \n \n —  \n \n4  \n \n —  \nInterest rate swap contracts\n \n \n3   \n —   \n3   \n —  \n \n100\n \nTable of Contents \nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of items measured at fair value on a recurring basis in\nthe table above that used significant unobservable inputs (level 3).\n \n(Millions)\n     \n \n     \n \n     \n \n \nMarketable securities — certain U.S. municipal securities and auction rate\n     \n \n     \n \n     \n \n \nsecurities only\n \n2015\n \n2014\n \n2013\n \nBeginning balance\n $\n15  $\n11  $\n7  \nTotal gains or losses:\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nIncluded in earnings\n \n \n —  \n \n(1) \n \n—  \nIncluded in other comprehensive income\n \n \n —  \n \n2  \n \n4  \nPurchases and issuances\n \n \n —  \n \n15  \n \n—  \nSales and settlements\n \n \n(3) \n \n(12) \n \n—  \nTransfers in and/or out of level 3\n \n \n—  \n \n—  \n \n—  \nEnding balance\n \n \n12  \n \n15  \n \n11  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nChange in unrealized gains or losses for the period included in earnings for\nsecurities held at the end of the reporting period\n \n \n—  \n \n—  \n \n—  \n \nIn addition, the plan assets of 3M’s pension and postretirement benefit plans are measured at fair value on a recurring basis (at least\nannually).

For 3M, such measurements of fair value relate primarily to long-lived asset\nimpairments. There were no material long-lived asset impairments for 2015, 2014 and 2013.\n \nFair Value of Financial Instruments:\n \nThe Company’s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, certain investments,\naccounts payable, borrowings, and derivative contracts. The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable,\nand short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt (except the medium-term fixed rate notes totaling $1 billion, which will\nmature in September 2016 and are shown separately in the table below) approximated carrying values because of the short-term nature of\nthese instruments. Available-for-sale marketable securities and investments, in addition to certain derivative instruments, are recorded at fair\nvalues as indicated in the preceding disclosures. For its long-term debt, the Company utilized third-party quotes to estimate fair values\n(classified as level 2).

Commitments and Contingencies \n \nCapital and Operating Leases:\n \nRental expense under operating leases was $316 million in 2015, $332 million in 2014 and $330 million in 2013. It is 3M’s practice to\nsecure renewal rights for leases, thereby giving 3M the right, but not the obligation, to maintain a presence in a leased facility. 3M has three\nprimary capital leases. First, 3M has a capital lease, which became effective in April 2003, that involves a building in the United Kingdom\n(with a lease term of 22 years). During the second quarter of 2003, 3M recorded a capital lease asset and obligation of approximately 33.5\nmillion British Pound (GBP), or approximately $50 million at December 31, 2015, exchange rates. Second, during the fourth quarter of\n2009, 3M recorded a capital lease asset and obligation of approximately $50 million related to an IT investment with an amortization period\nof seven years. Third, in the fourth quarter of 2014, 3M recorded a capital lease asset and obligation of approximately $15 million, which is\ndiscussed in more detail in Note 7.\n \nMinimum lease payments under capital and operating leases with non-cancelable terms in excess of one year as of December 31, 2015, were\nas follows:\n \n \n        \n \n    \nOperating\n \n(Millions)\n \nCapital Leases\n \nLeases\n \n2016\n $\n11  $\n234  \n2017\n \n \n6  \n \n191  \n2018\n \n \n4  \n \n134  \n2019\n \n \n3  \n \n86  \n2020\n \n \n3  \n \n72  \nAfter 2020\n \n \n32  \n \n226  \nTotal\n $\n59  $\n943  \nLess: Amounts representing interest\n \n \n5  \n \n  \nPresent value of future minimum lease payments\n \n \n54  \n \n  \nLess: Current obligations under capital leases\n \n \n8  \n \n  \nLong-term obligations under capital leases\n $\n46  \n \n  \n \nUnconditional Purchase Obligations:\n \nUnconditional purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding (non-\ncancelable, or cancelable only in certain circumstances). The Company estimates its total unconditional purchase obligation commitment\n(for those contracts with terms in excess of one year) as of December 31, 2015, at $596 million. Payments by year are estimated as follows:\n2016 ($193 million), 2017 ($160 million), 2018 ($102 million), 2019 ($54 million), 2020 ($56 million) and after 2020 ($31 million). Many\nof these commitments relate to take or pay contracts, in which 3M guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or services that are\nsold to customers. The Company expects to receive consideration (products or services) for these unconditional purchase obligations. The\npurchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items for which the\nCompany is contractually obligated. The majority of 3M’s products and services are purchased as needed, with no unconditional\ncommitment. For this reason, these amounts will not provide an indication of the Company’s expected future cash outflows related to\npurchase obligations.\n \nWarranties/Guarantees:\n \n3M’s accrued product warranty liabilities, recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as part of current and long-term liabilities, are\nestimated at approximately $28 million at December 31, 2015, and $30 million at December 31, 2014. 3M does not consider this amount to\nbe material. The fair value of 3M guarantees of loans with third parties and other guarantee arrangements are not material.\n \n102\n \nTable of Contents \nRelated Party Activity:\n \n3M does not have any material related party activity.\n \nLegal Proceedings:\n \nThe Company and some of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous claims and lawsuits, principally in the United States, and regulatory\nproceedings worldwide. These include various products liability (involving products that the Company now or formerly manufactured and\nsold), intellectual property, and commercial claims and lawsuits, including those brought under the antitrust laws, and environmental\nproceedings. Unless otherwise stated, the Company is vigorously defending all such litigation.\n \nProcess for Disclosure and Recording of Liabilities and Insurance Receivables Related to Legal Proceedings\n \nMany lawsuits and claims involve highly complex issues relating to causation, scientific evidence, and whether there are actual damages and\nare otherwise subject to substantial uncertainties. Assessments of lawsuits and claims can involve a series of complex judgments about\nfuture events and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. The Company complies with the requirements of ASC 450, Contingencies,\nand related guidance, and records liabilities for legal proceedings in those instances where it can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss\nand where liability is probable. Where the reasonable estimate of the probable loss is a range, the Company records the most likely estimate\nof the loss, or the low end of the range if there is no one best estimate. The Company either discloses the amount of a possible loss or range\nof loss in excess of established accruals if estimable, or states that such an estimate cannot be made. The Company discloses significant\nlegal proceedings even where liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable, or both, if the Company believes there\nis at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred.\n \nThe Company estimates insurance receivables based on an analysis of its numerous policies, including their exclusions, pertinent case law\ninterpreting comparable policies, its experience with similar claims, and assessment of the nature of the claim and remaining coverage, and\nrecords an amount it has concluded is likely to be recovered. For those insured matters where the Company has taken an accrual, the\nCompany also records receivables for the amount of insurance that it expects to recover under the Company’s insurance program. For those\ninsured matters where the Company has not taken an accrual because the liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not\nestimable, or both, but where the Company has incurred an expense in defending itself, the Company records receivables for the amount of\ninsurance that it expects to recover for the expense incurred.\n \nBecause litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings or developments could occur, there can be no certainty that\nthe Company may not ultimately incur charges in excess of presently recorded liabilities. A future adverse ruling, settlement, or unfavorable\ndevelopment could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations or cash flows in\nthe period in which they are recorded. Although the Company cannot estimate its exposure to all legal proceedings, it currently believes that\nsuch future charges, if any, would not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of the Company. Based on\nexperience and developments, the Company reexamines its estimates of probable liabilities and associated expenses and receivables each\nperiod, and whether it is able to estimate a liability previously determined to be not estimable and/or not probable. Where appropriate, the\nCompany makes additions to or adjustments of its estimated liabilities. As a result, the current estimates of the potential impact on the\nCompany’s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the legal proceedings and claims pending against the\nCompany could change in the future.\n \nThe following sections first describe the significant legal proceedings in which the Company is involved, and then describe the liabilities\nand associated insurance receivables the Company has accrued relating to its significant legal proceedings.\n \n103\n \nTable of Contents \nRespirator Mask/Asbestos Litigation\n \nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company is a named defendant, with multiple co-defendants, in numerous lawsuits in various courts that\npurport to represent approximately 2,130 individual claimants, compared to approximately 2,220 individual claimants with actions pending\nat December 31, 2014.\n \nThe vast majority of the lawsuits and claims resolved by and currently pending against the Company allege use of some of the Company’s\nmask and respirator products and seek damages from the Company and other defendants for alleged personal injury from workplace\nexposures to asbestos, silica, coal mine dust or other occupational dusts found in products manufactured by other defendants or generally in\nthe workplace. A minority of the lawsuits and claims resolved by and currently pending against the Company generally allege personal\ninjury from occupational exposure to asbestos from products previously manufactured by the Company, which are often unspecified, as\nwell as products manufactured by other defendants, or occasionally at Company premises.\n \nThe Company’s current volume of new and pending matters is substantially lower than it experienced at the peak of filings in 2003. The\nCompany expects that filing of claims by unimpaired claimants in the future will continue to be at much lower levels than in the past.\nAccordingly, the number of claims alleging more serious injuries, including mesothelioma and other malignancies, will represent a greater\npercentage of total claims than in the past. The Company has prevailed in all ten cases taken to trial, including eight of the nine cases tried to\nverdict (such trials occurred in 1999, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2004, 2007, and 2015), and an appellate reversal in 2005 of the 2001 jury verdict\nadverse to the Company. The remaining case, tried in 2009, was dismissed by the court at the close of plaintiff’s evidence, based on the\ncourt’s legal finding that the plaintiff had not presented sufficient evidence to support a jury verdict.\n \nThe Company has demonstrated in these past trial proceedings\n\n--------------------------------\nAnd here is your task:\n\nExtract the exact total revenue (or net sales) figure for 2014 in billions of dollars.

Consequently the Company believes that claimants are unable to establish that their\nmedical conditions, even if significant, are attributable to the Company’s respiratory protection products. Nonetheless the Company’s\nlitigation experience indicates that claims of persons with malignant conditions are costlier to resolve than the claims of unimpaired persons,\nand it therefore believes the average cost of resolving pending and future claims on a per-claim basis will continue to be higher than it\nexperienced in prior periods when the vast majority of claims were asserted by the unimpaired.\n \nAs previously reported, the State of West Virginia, through its Attorney General, filed a complaint in 2003 against the Company and two\nother manufacturers of respiratory protection products in the Circuit Court of Lincoln County, West Virginia, and amended its complaint in\n2005. The amended complaint seeks substantial, but unspecified, compensatory damages primarily for reimbursement of the costs allegedly\nincurred by the State for worker’s compensation and healthcare benefits provided to all workers with occupational pneumoconiosis and\nunspecified punitive damages. The case has been inactive since the fourth quarter of 2007, other than a case management conference in\nMarch 2011. In November 2013, the State filed a motion to bifurcate the lawsuit into separate liability and damages proceedings. At the\nhearing on the motion, the court declined to bifurcate the lawsuit. No liability has been recorded for this matter because the Company\nbelieves that liability is not probable and estimable at this time. In addition, the Company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of\nloss given the lack of any meaningful discovery responses by the State of West Virginia, the otherwise minimal activity in this case and the\nfact that the complaint asserts claims against two other manufacturers where a defendant’s share of liability may turn on the law of joint and\nseveral liability and by the amount of fault, if any, a jury might allocate to each defendant if the case is ultimately tried.\n \nRespirator Mask/Asbestos Liabilities and Insurance Receivables: The Company estimates its respirator mask/asbestos liabilities, including\nthe cost to resolve the claims and defense costs, by examining: (i) the Company’s experience in resolving claims, (ii) apparent trends,\n(iii) the apparent quality of claims (e.g., whether the claim has been asserted on behalf of asymptomatic claimants), (iv) changes in the\nnature and mix of claims (e.g., the proportion of claims asserting usage of the Company’s mask or respirator products and alleging exposure\nto each of asbestos, silica, coal or other occupational dusts, and claims pleading use of asbestos-containing products allegedly manufactured\nby the Company), (v) the number of current claims and a projection of the number of future asbestos and other claims that may be filed\nagainst the Company, (vi) the cost to resolve recently settled claims, and (vii) an estimate of the cost to resolve and defend against current\nand future claims.\n104\n \nTable of Contents \n \nDevelopments may occur that could affect the Company’s estimate of its liabilities. These developments include, but are not limited to,\nsignificant changes in (i) the number of future claims, (ii) the average cost of resolving claims, (iii) the legal costs of defending these claims\nand in maintaining trial readiness, (iv) changes in the mix and nature of claims received, (v) trial and appellate outcomes, (vi) changes in the\nlaw and procedure applicable to these claims, and (vii) the financial viability of other co-defendants and insurers.\n \nAs a result of the Company’s cost of resolving claims of persons who claim more serious injuries, including mesothelioma and other\nmalignancies, the Company increased its accruals in 2015 for respirator mask/asbestos liabilities by $50 million. In 2015, the Company\nmade payments for legal fees and settlements of $46 million related to the respirator mask/asbestos litigation. As of December 31, 2015, the\nCompany had accruals for respirator mask/asbestos liabilities of $144 million (excluding Aearo accruals). This accrual represents the low\nend in a range of loss. The Company cannot estimate the amount or upper end of the range of amounts by which the liability may exceed the\naccrual the Company has established because of the (i) inherent difficulty in projecting the number of claims that have not yet been asserted\nor the time period in which future claims may be asserted, (ii) the complaints nearly always assert claims against multiple defendants where\nthe damages alleged are typically not attributed to individual defendants so that a defendant’s share of liability may turn on the law of joint\nand several liability, which can vary by state, (iii) the multiple factors described above that the Company considers in estimating its\nliabilities, and (iv) the several possible developments described above that may occur that could affect the Company’s estimate of liabilities.\n \nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company’s receivable for insurance recoveries related to the respirator mask/asbestos litigation was $39\nmillion. The Company estimates insurance receivables based on an analysis of its policies, including their exclusions, pertinent case law\ninterpreting comparable policies, its experience with similar claims, and an assessment of the nature of each claim and remaining coverage.\nThe Company then records an amount it has concluded is likely to be recovered. Various factors could affect the timing and amount of\nrecovery of this receivable, including (i) delays in or avoidance of payment by insurers; (ii) the extent to which insurers may become\ninsolvent in the future, and (iii) the outcome of negotiations with insurers and legal proceedings with respect to respirator mask/asbestos\nliability insurance coverage.\n \nThe Company has unresolved coverage with claims-made carriers for respirator mask claims. The Company is also seeking coverage under\nthe policies of certain insolvent insurers. Once those claims for coverage are resolved, the Company will have collected substantially all of\nits remaining insurance coverage for respirator mask/asbestos claims.\n \nRespirator Mask/Asbestos Litigation — Aearo Technologies\n \nOn April 1, 2008, a subsidiary of the Company purchased the stock of Aearo Holding Corp., the parent of Aearo Technologies (“Aearo”).\nAearo manufactured and sold various products, including personal protection equipment, such as eye, ear, head, face, fall and certain\nrespiratory protection products.\n \nAs of December 31, 2015, Aearo and/or other companies that previously owned and operated Aearo’s respirator business (American Optical\nCorporation, Warner-Lambert LLC, AO Corp. and Cabot Corporation (“Cabot”)) are named defendants, with multiple co-defendants,\nincluding the Company, in numerous lawsuits in various courts in which plaintiffs allege use of mask and respirator products and seek\ndamages from Aearo and other defendants for alleged personal injury from workplace exposures to asbestos, silica-related, or other\noccupational dusts found in products manufactured by other defendants or generally in the workplace.\n \nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company, through its Aearo subsidiary, had accruals of $21 million for product liabilities and defense costs\nrelated to current and future Aearo-related asbestos and silica-related claims. Responsibility for legal costs, as well as for settlements and\njudgments, is currently shared in an informal arrangement among Aearo, Cabot, American Optical Corporation and a subsidiary of Warner\nLambert and their respective insurers (the “Payor Group”). Liability is allocated among the parties based on the number of years each\ncompany sold respiratory products under the “AO Safety” brand and/or owned the AO Safety Division of American Optical Corporation\nand the alleged years of exposure of the individual plaintiff. Aearo’s share of the contingent liability is further limited by an agreement\nentered into between Aearo and Cabot on July 11, 1995. This agreement provides that, so long as Aearo pays to Cabot a\n105\n \nTable of Contents \nquarterly fee of $100,000, Cabot will retain responsibility and liability for, and indemnify Aearo against, any product liability claims\ninvolving exposure to asbestos, silica, or  silica products for respirators sold prior to July 11, 1995. Because of the difficulty in determining\nhow long a particular respirator remains in the stream of commerce after being sold, Aearo and Cabot have applied the agreement to claims\narising out of the alleged use of respirators involving exposure to asbestos, silica or silica products prior to January 1, 1997. With these\narrangements in place, Aearo’s potential liability is limited to exposures alleged to have arisen from the use of respirators involving\nexposure to asbestos, silica, or silica products on or after January 1, 1997. To date, Aearo has elected to pay the quarterly fee. Aearo could\npotentially be exposed to additional claims for some part of the pre-July 11, 1995 period covered by its agreement with Cabot if Aearo elects\nto discontinue its participation in this arrangement, or if Cabot is no longer able to meet its obligations in these matters.\n \nIn March 2012, Cabot CSC Corporation and Cabot Corporation filed a lawsuit against Aearo in the Superior Court of Suffolk County,\nMassachusetts seeking declaratory relief as to the scope of Cabot’s indemnity obligations under the July 11, 1995 agreement, including\nwhether Cabot has retained liability for coal workers’ pneumoconiosis claims, and seeking damages for breach of contract. In June 2014, the\ncourt granted Aearo’s motion for summary judgment on all claims. Cabot has filed a motion for reconsideration, and A\n\n--------------------------------\nAnd here is your task:\n\nExtract the exact total revenue (or net sales) figure for 2014 in billions of dollars.

In October 2014, the court denied Aearo’s motion for clarification.\nThe court also denied, in part, Cabot’s motion for reconsideration and reaffirmed its ruling that Cabot retained liability for claims involving\nexposure to silica in coal mine dust. The court granted Cabot’s motion, in part, ruling that Aearo was not entitled to summary judgment on\nCabot’s claim for equitable allocation, and on whether the 258 underlying claims were Cabot’s responsibility. These two issues remain in the\ncase for further proceedings. New motions for summary judgment were filed and the court heard oral arguments in October 2015.\n \nDevelopments may occur that could affect the estimate of Aearo’s liabilities.

The Company cannot determine the impact of these potential developments on its current estimate of Aearo’s share of liability\nfor these existing and future claims. If any of the developments described above were to occur, the actual amount of these liabilities for\nexisting and future claims could be significantly larger than the amount accrued.\n \nBecause of the inherent difficulty in projecting the number of claims that have not yet been asserted, the complexity of allocating\nresponsibility for future claims among the Payor Group, and the several possible developments that may occur that could affect the estimate\nof Aearo’s liabilities, the Company cannot estimate the amount or range of amounts by which Aearo’s liability may exceed the accrual the\nCompany has established.\n \nEnvironmental Matters and Litigation\n \nThe Company’s operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations including those pertaining to air emissions, wastewater\ndischarges, toxic substances, and the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes enforceable by national, state, and local\nauthorities around the world, and private parties in the United States and abroad. These laws and regulations provide, under certain\ncircumstances, a basis for the remediation of contamination, for restoration of or compensation for damages to natural resources, and for\npersonal injury and property damage claims. The Company has incurred, and will continue to incur, costs and capital expenditures in\ncomplying with these laws and regulations, defending personal injury and property damage claims, and modifying its business operations in\nlight of its environmental responsibilities. In its effort to satisfy its environmental responsibilities and comply with environmental laws and\nregulations, the Company has established, and periodically updates, policies relating to environmental standards of performance for its\noperations worldwide.\n \nUnder certain environmental laws, including the United States Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of\n1980 and similar state laws, the Company may be jointly and severally liable, typically with other\n106\n \nTable of Contents \ncompanies, for the costs of remediation of environmental contamination at current or former facilities and at off-site locations. The\nCompany has identified numerous locations, most of which are in the United States, at which it may have some liability. Please refer to the\nsection entitled “Environmental Liabilities and Insurance Receivables” that follows for information on the amount of the accrual.\n \nEnvironmental Matters\n \nAs previously reported, the Company has been voluntarily cooperating with ongoing reviews by local, state, federal (primarily the U.S.\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA)), and international agencies of possible environmental and health effects of various perfluorinated\ncompounds (“PFCs”), including perfluorooctanyl compounds such as perfluorooctanoate (“PFOA”) and perfluorooctane sulfonate\n(“PFOS”). As a result of its phase-out decision in May 2000, the Company no longer manufactures perfluorooctanyl compounds. The\ncompany ceased manufacturing and using the vast majority of these compounds within approximately two years of the phase-out\nannouncement, and ceased all manufacturing and the last significant use of this chemistry by the end of 2008. Through its ongoing life cycle\nmanagement and its raw material composition identification processes associated with the Company’s policies covering the use of all\npersistent and bio-accumulative materials, the Company has on occasion identified the presence of precursor chemicals in materials received\nfrom suppliers that may ultimately degrade to PFOA, PFOS, or similar compounds. Upon such identification, the Company works to find\nalternatives for such materials.\n \nRegulatory activities concerning PFOA and/or PFOS continue in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, and before certain international\nbodies. These activities include gathering of exposure and use information, risk assessment, and consideration of regulatory approaches. As\nthe database of studies of both chemicals has expanded, the EPA has developed draft human health effects documents summarizing the\navailable data from these studies. In February 2014, the EPA initiated external peer review of its draft human health effects documents for\nPFOA and PFOS. The peer review panel met in August 2014. The EPA has stated that following the peer review process it will revise its\nhealth effects documents and use them to establish lifetime health advisories for PFOS and PFOA in drinking water. Lifetime health\nadvisories, while not enforceable, serve as guidance and are benchmarks for determining if concentrations of chemicals in tap water from\npublic utilities are safe for public consumption. Once finalized, the EPA stated that the lifetime health advisories are expected to supersede\nthe provisional health advisories for PFOA and PFOS in drinking water issued by the EPA in 2009 — currently at 0.4 micrograms per liter\nfor PFOA and 0.2 micrograms per liter for PFOS. In an effort to collect exposure information under the Safe Drinking Water Act, the EPA\npublished on May 2, 2012 a list of unregulated substances, including six PFCs, required to be monitored during the period 2013-2015 by\npublic water system supplies to determine the extent of their occurrence. The EPA is reporting results from this exercise on a rolling basis\nthat will continue in 2016. Through year-end 2015, the EPA has reported results for 4,764 public water supplies nationwide. None of these\nhave reported PFOA above the provisional health advisory level issued by the EPA in 2009, and seventeen have reported PFOS levels\nabove the 2009 provisional health advisory.\n \nThe Company is continuing to make progress in its work, under the supervision of state regulators, to address its historic disposal of PFC-\ncontaining waste associated with manufacturing operations at the Decatur, Alabama, Cottage Grove, Minnesota, and Cordova, Illinois\nplants.\n \nAs previously reported, the Company entered into a voluntary remedial action agreement with the Alabama Department of Environmental\nManagement (ADEM) to address the presence of PFCs in the soil at the Company’s manufacturing facility in Decatur, Alabama. Pursuant to\na permit issued by ADEM, for approximately twenty years, the Company incorporated its wastewater treatment plant sludge containing\nPFCs in fields at its Decatur facility. After a review of the available options to address the presence of PFCs in the soil, ADEM agreed that\nthe preferred remediation option is to use a multilayer cap over the former sludge incorporation areas on the manufacturing site with\nsubsequent groundwater migration controls and treatment. Implementation of that option will continue and is expected to be completed in\n2018.\n \nThe Company continues to work with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) pursuant to the terms of the previously disclosed\nMay 2007 Settlement Agreement and Consent Order to address the presence of certain PFCs in the soil and groundwater at former disposal\nsites in Washington County, Minnesota (Oakdale and Woodbury) and at the Company’s manufacturing facility at Cottage Grove,\nMinnesota. Under this agreement, the Company’s principal obligations include (i) evaluating releases of certain PFCs from these sites and\nproposing response actions; (ii) providing\n107\n \nTable of Contents \ntreatment or alternative drinking water upon identifying any level exceeding a Health Based Value (“HBV”) or Health Risk Limit (“HRL”)\n(i.e., the amount of a chemical in drinking water determined by the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) to be safe for human\nconsumption over a lifetime) for certain PFCs  for which a HBV and/or HRL exists as a result of contamination from these sites;\n(iii) remediating identified sources of other PFCs at these sites that are not controlled by actions to remediate PFOA and PFOS; and\n(iv) sharing information with the MPCA about certain perfluorinated compounds. During 2008, the MPCA issued formal decisions adopting\nremedial options for the former disposal sites in Washington County, Minnesota (Oakdale and Woodbury). In August 2009, the MPCA\nissued a formal decision adopting remedial options for the Company’s Cottage Grove manufacturing facility.

At each location the remedial options were recommended by the Company and approved by the\nMPCA. Remediation work has been completed at the Oakdale and Woodbury sites, and they are in an operational maintenance mode.\nRemediation will continue at the Cottage Grove site during 2016.\n \nIn August 2014, the Illinois EPA approved a request by the Company to establish a groundwater management zone at its manufacturing\nfacility in Cordova, Illinois, which includes ongoing pumping of impacted site groundwater, groundwater monitoring and routine reporting\nof results.\n \nThe Company cannot predict what additional regulatory actions arising from the foregoing proceedings and activities, if any, may be taken\nregarding such compounds or the consequences of any such actions.\n \nEnvironmental Litigation\n \nAs previously reported, a former employee filed a purported class action lawsuit in 2002 in the Circuit Court of Morgan County, Alabama\n(the “St. John” case), seeking unstated damages and alleging that the plaintiffs suffered fear, increased risk, subclinical injuries, and\nproperty damage from exposure to certain perfluorochemicals at or near the Company’s Decatur, Alabama, manufacturing facility. The\ncourt in 2005 granted the Company’s motion to dismiss the named plaintiff’s personal injury-related claims on the basis that such claims are\nbarred by the exclusivity provisions of the state’s Workers Compensation Act. The plaintiffs’ counsel filed an amended complaint in\nNovember 2006, limiting the case to property damage claims on behalf of a purported class of residents and property owners in the vicinity\nof the Decatur plant. In June 2015, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint adding additional defendants, including BFI Waste\nManagement Systems of Alabama, LLC; BFI Waste Management of North America, LLC; the City of Decatur, Alabama; Morgan County,\nAlabama; Municipal Utilities Board of Decatur; and Morgan County, Alabama, d/b/a Decatur Utilities. In September 2015, the court issued\na scheduling order staying discovery pending mediation which occurred in January 2016, but did not resolve the case. Discovery relating to\nthe class certification will begin, and the class certification hearing is scheduled for November 2016.\n \nIn 2005, the judge in a second purported class action lawsuit filed by three residents of Morgan County, Alabama, seeking unstated\ncompensatory and punitive damages involving alleged damage to their property from emissions of certain perfluorochemical compounds\nfrom the Company’s Decatur, Alabama, manufacturing facility that formerly manufactured those compounds (the “Chandler” case) granted\nthe Company’s motion to abate the case, effectively putting the case on hold pending the resolution of class certification issues in the St.\nJohn case. Despite the stay, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint seeking damages for alleged personal injuries and property damage on\nbehalf of the named plaintiffs and the members of a purported class. No further action in the case is expected unless and until the stay is\nlifted.\n \nIn February 2009, a resident of Franklin County, Alabama, filed a purported class action lawsuit in the Circuit Court of Franklin County (the\n“Stover” case) seeking compensatory damages and injunctive relief based on the application by the Decatur utility’s wastewater treatment\nplant of wastewater treatment sludge to farmland and grasslands in the state that allegedly contain PFOA, PFOS and other\nperfluorochemicals. The named plaintiff seeks to represent a class of all persons within the State of Alabama who have had PFOA, PFOS,\nand other perfluorochemicals released or deposited on their property. In March 2010, the Alabama Supreme Court ordered the case\ntransferred from Franklin County to Morgan County. In May 2010, consistent with its handling of the other matters, the Morgan County\nCircuit Court abated this case, putting it on hold pending the resolution of the class certification issues in the St. John case.\n108\n \nTable of Contents \n \nIn October 2015, West Morgan-East Lawrence Water & Sewer Authority (“Water Authority”) filed an individual complaint against 3M\nCompany, Dyneon, L.L.C, and Daikin America, Inc., in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama.  The complaint also\nincludes representative plaintiffs who brought the complaint on behalf of themselves, and a class of all owners and possessors of property\nwho use water provided by the Water Authority and five local water works to which the Water Authority supplies water (collectively, the\n“Water Utilities”).  The complaint seeks compensatory and punitive damages and injunctive relief based on allegations that the defendants’\nchemicals, including PFOA and PFOS from their manufacturing processes in Decatur, have contaminated the water in the Tennessee River\nat the water intake, and that the chemicals cannot be removed by the water treatment processes utilized by the Water Authority.\n \nIn December 2010, the State of Minnesota, by its Attorney General Lori Swanson, acting in its capacity as trustee of the natural resources of\nthe State of Minnesota, filed a lawsuit in Hennepin County District Court against 3M to recover damages (including unspecified assessment\ncosts and reasonable attorney’s fees) for alleged injury to, destruction of, and loss of use of certain of the State’s natural resources under the\nMinnesota Environmental Response and Liability Act (MERLA) and the Minnesota Water Pollution Control Act (MWPCA), as well as\nstatutory nuisance and common law claims of trespass, nuisance, and negligence with respect to the presence of PFCs in the groundwater,\nsurface water, fish or other aquatic life, and sediments (the “NRD Lawsuit”). The State also seeks declarations under MERLA that 3M is\nresponsible for all damages the State may suffer in the future for injuries to natural resources from releases of PFCs into the environment,\nand under MWPCA that 3M is responsible for compensation for future loss or destruction of fish, aquatic life, and other damages.\n \nIn November 2011, the Metropolitan Council filed a motion to intervene and a complaint in the NRD Lawsuit seeking compensatory\ndamages and other legal, declaratory and equitable relief, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, for costs and fees that the Metropolitan\nCouncil alleges it will be required to assess at some time in the future if the MPCA imposes restrictions on Metropolitan Council’s PFOS\ndischarges to the Mississippi River, including the installation and maintenance of a water treatment system. The Metropolitan Council’s\nintervention motion was based on several theories, including common law negligence, and statutory claims under MERLA for response\ncosts, and under the Minnesota Environmental Rights Act (MERA) for declaratory and equitable relief against 3M for PFOS and other PFC\npollution of the waters and sediments of the Mississippi River. 3M did not object to the motion to intervene. In January 2012, 3M answered\nthe Metropolitan Council’s complaint and filed a counterclaim alleging that the Metropolitan Council discharges PFCs to the Mississippi\nRiver and discharges PFC-containing sludge and bio solids from one or more of its wastewater treatment plants onto agricultural lands and\nlocal area landfills. Accordingly, 3M requested that if the court finds that the State is entitled to any of the damages the State seeks, 3M\nseeks contribution and apportionment from the Metropolitan Council, including attorneys’ fees, under MERLA, and contribution from and\nliability for the Metropolitan Council’s proportional share of damages awarded to the State under the MWPCA, as well as under statutory\nnuisance and common law theories of trespass, nuisance, and negligence. 3M also seeks declaratory relief under MERA.\n \nIn April 2012, 3M filed a motion to disqualify the State of Minnesota’s counsel, Covington & Burling, LLP (Covington). In October 2012,\nthe court granted 3M’s motion to disqualify Covington as counsel to the State and the State and Covington appealed the court’s\ndisqualification to the Minnesota Court of Appeals. In July 2013, the Minnesota Court of Appeals affirmed the district court’s\ndisqualification order. In October 2013, the Minnesota Supreme Court granted both the State’s and Covington’s petition for review of the\ndecision of the Minnesota Court of Appeals. In April 2014, the Minnesota Supreme Court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded\nthe case to the district court for further proceedings. The district court took evidence on the disqualification issues at a hearing in October\n2015. In February 2016, the district court ruled that Covington violated the professional ethics rule against representing a client (here the\nState of Minnesota) in the same or substantially related matter where that person’s interests are materially adverse to the interests of a\nformer client (3M). The district court, however, denied 3M’s motion to disqualify Covington because it further found that 3M impliedly\nwaived by delaying to assert the conflict. 3M is reviewing the district court’s opinion to determine next steps.

For those matters for which a liability has not been recorded, the Company\nbelieves any such liability is not probable and estimable and the Company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss at this time.\n \nEnvironmental Liabilities and Insurance Receivables\n \nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company had recorded liabilities of $43 million for estimated “environmental remediation” costs based upon\nan evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site and also recorded related insurance receivables of $11 million.\nThe Company records liabilities for remediation costs on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally\nno later than the completion of feasibility studies or the Company’s commitment to a plan of action. Liabilities for estimated costs of\nenvironmental remediation, depending on the site, are based primarily upon internal or third-party environmental studies, and estimates as\nto the number, participation level and financial viability of any other potentially responsible parties, the extent of the contamination and the\nnature of required remedial actions. The Company adjusts recorded liabilities as further information develops or circumstances change. The\nCompany expects that it will pay the amounts recorded over the periods of remediation for the applicable sites, currently ranging up to 20\nyears.\n \nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company had recorded liabilities of $35 million for “other environmental liabilities” based upon an\nevaluation of currently available facts to implement the Settlement Agreement and Consent Order with the MPCA, the remedial action\nagreement with ADEM, and to address trace amounts of perfluorinated compounds in drinking water sources in the City of Oakdale,\nMinnesota, as well as presence in the soil and groundwater at the Company’s manufacturing facilities in Decatur, Alabama, and Cottage\nGrove, Minnesota, and at two former disposal sites in Washington County, Minnesota (Oakdale and Woodbury). The Company expects that\nmost of the spending will occur over the next four years. As of December 31, 2015, the Company’s receivable for insurance recoveries\nrelated to “other environmental liabilities” was $15 million.\n \nIt is difficult to estimate the cost of environmental compliance and remediation given the uncertainties regarding the interpretation and\nenforcement of applicable environmental laws and regulations, the extent of environmental contamination and the existence of alternative\ncleanup methods. Developments may occur that could affect the Company’s current assessment, including, but not limited to: (i) changes in\nthe information available regarding the environmental impact of the Company’s operations and products; (ii) changes in environmental\nregulations, changes in permissible levels of specific compounds in drinking water sources, or changes in enforcement theories and policies,\nincluding efforts to recover natural resource damages; (iii) new and evolving analytical and remediation techniques; (iv) success in\nallocating liability to other potentially responsible parties; and (v) the financial viability of other potentially responsible parties and third-\nparty indemnitors. For sites included in both “environmental remediation liabilities” and “other environmental liabilities,” at which\nremediation activity is largely complete and remaining activity relates primarily to operation and maintenance of the remedy, including\nrequired post-remediation monitoring, the Company believes the exposure to loss in excess of the amount accrued would not be material to\nthe Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition. However, for locations at which remediation activity is largely\nongoing, the Company cannot estimate a possible loss or range of loss in excess of the associated established accruals for the reasons\ndescribed above.\n \nOther Matters\n \nCommercial Litigation\n \n3M sued TransWeb Corporation in Minnesota in 2010 for infringement of several 3M patents covering fluorination and hydrocharging of\nfilter media used in 3M’s respirators and furnace filters. TransWeb filed a declaratory judgment action in and successfully moved the\nlitigation to the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, seeking a declaration of invalidity and non-infringement of 3M’s patents,\nand further alleging that 3M waited too long to enforce its rights. TransWeb also alleged 3M obtained the patents through inequitable\nconduct and that 3M’s attempt to enforce the patents constituted a violation of the antitrust laws. In November 2012, a jury returned a\nverdict in favor of TransWeb on all but\n110\n \nTable of Contents \none count, including findings that 3M’s patents were invalid and not infringed, and that 3M had committed an antitrust violation by seeking\nto enforce a patent it had obtained fraudulently. The jury also recommended that the court find 3M had committed inequitable conduct in\nobtaining the patents, and that the patents were therefore unenforceable. Since the vast majority of TransWeb’s claim for treble antitrust\ndamages was in the form of its attorneys’ fees and expenses in connection with the defense of the patent case, the parties agreed that the\nmeasure of damages would not go to the jury, but rather would be submitted to a special master after the trial.  In April, 2014, the court\nissued an order denying 3M’s motions to set aside the jury’s verdict. In addition, the court found two 3M patents unenforceable due to\ninequitable conduct. The court accepted the special master’s recommendation as to the amount of attorneys’ fees to be awarded as damages,\nand entered judgment against 3M in the amount of approximately $26 million. In July 2014, 3M filed a notice of appeal of the judgment to\nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On February 10, 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued its\ndecision affirming the lower court’s judgment. 3M is reviewing the appellate court’s decision to determine next steps. The impact of the\nappellate court’s decision is not material to the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition.\n \nProduct Liability Litigation\n \nÉlectricité de France (EDF) filed a lawsuit against 3M France in the French courts in 2006 claiming commercial loss and property damage\nafter experiencing electrical network failures which EDF claims were caused by allegedly defective 3M transition splices. The French Court\nof Appeals at Versailles affirmed the commercial trial court’s decision that the transition splices conformed to contract specifications and\nthat EDF thoroughly analyzed and tested the splices before purchase and installation. The Court of Appeals, however, ordered a court-\nappointed expert to study the problem and issue a technical opinion on the cause of the network failures. The court-appointed expert\nsubmitted his report to the commercial court in May 2014. The expert found potential defects in 3M’s product and found that EDF incurred\ndamages in excess of 100 million Euros. The expert’s opinion is not dispositive of liability or damages and is subject to numerous factual\nand legal challenges that will be raised with the court. The parties are briefing the court on their respective positions. Once the briefing is\ncomplete, the commercial court may take from six months to one year to render its decision.\n \nOne customer obtained an order in the French courts against 3M Purification SAS (a French subsidiary) in October 2011 appointing an\nexpert to determine the amount of commercial loss and property damage allegedly caused by allegedly defective 3M filters used in the\ncustomer’s manufacturing process. An Austrian subsidiary of this same customer also filed a claim against 3M Austria GmbH (an Austrian\nsubsidiary) and 3M Purification SAS in the Austrian courts in September 2012 seeking damages for the same issue. Those two cases are still\npending. Another customer filed a lawsuit against 3M Deutschland GmbH (a German subsidiary) in the German courts in March 2012\nseeking commercial loss and property damage allegedly caused by the same 3M filters used in that customer’s manufacturing process; the\nCompany has resolved the claims in the German litigation. The Company has also settled without litigation the claims of two other\ncustomers arising out of the same issue. The amounts paid are not material to the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial\ncondition.\n \nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company is a named defendant in 122 lawsuits, most of which are pending in federal or state court in\nMinnesota, in which the plaintiffs claim they underwent various joint arthroplasty, cardiovascular, and other surgeries and later developed\nsurgical site infections due to the use of the Bair Hugger™ patient warming system.  The U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation\ngranted the plaintiffs’ motion to transfer and consolidate all cases pending in federal courts to the U.S. District Court for the District of\nMinnesota to be managed in a multi-district proceeding during the pre-trial phase of the litigation.\n \nThe Bair Hugger™ product line was acquired by 3M as part of the 2010 acquisition of Arizant, Inc., a leading manufacturer of patient\nwarming solutions designed to prevent hypothermia and maintain normal body temperature in surgical settings. No liability has been\nrecorded for this matter because the Company believes that any such liability is not probable and estimable at this time.\n \nFor product liability litigation matters described in this section for which a liability has been recorded, the Company believes the amount\nrecorded is not material to the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition.\n111\n \nTable of Contents \nIn addition, the Company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss in excess of the established accruals at this time.\n \n NOT\n\n--------------------------------\nAnd here is your task:\n\nExtract the exact total revenue (or net sales) figure for 2014 in billions of dollars.

Stock-Based Compensation\n \nThe 3M 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan provides for the issuance or delivery of up to 100 million shares of 3M common stock (including\nadditional shareholder approvals subsequent to 2008) pursuant to awards granted under the plan. Awards under this plan may be issued in\nthe form of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, progressive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock,\nrestricted stock units, other stock awards, and performance units and performance shares. Awards denominated in shares of common stock\nother than options and stock appreciation rights, per the 2008 Plan, count against the 100 million share limit as 3.38 shares for every one\nshare covered by such award (for full value awards with grant dates prior to May 11, 2010), as 2.87 shares for every one share covered by\nsuch award (for full value awards with grant dates on or after May 11, 2010, and prior to May 8, 2012), or as 3.50 shares for every one share\ncovered by such award (for full value awards with grant dates of May 8, 2012 or later). The remaining total shares available for grant under\nthe 2008 Long Term Incentive Plan Program are 20,328,681 as of December 31, 2015. There were approximately 9,200 participants with\noutstanding options, restricted stock, or restricted stock units at December 31, 2015.\n \nThe Company’s annual stock option and restricted stock unit grant is made in February to provide a strong and immediate link between the\nperformance of individuals during the preceding year and the size of their annual stock compensation grants. The grant to eligible employees\nuses the closing stock price on the grant date. Accounting rules require recognition of expense under a non-substantive vesting period\napproach, requiring compensation expense recognition when an employee is eligible to retire. Employees are considered eligible to retire at\nage 55 and after having completed five years of service. This retiree-eligible population represents 35 percent of the 2015 annual stock-\nbased compensation award expense dollars; therefore, higher stock-based compensation expense is recognized in the first quarter. 3M also\nhas granted progressive (reload) options. These options are nonqualified stock options that were granted to certain participants under the\n1997 or 2002 Management Stock Ownership Program, but for which the reload feature was eliminated in 2005 (on a prospective basis only).\n \nIn addition to the annual grants, the Company makes other minor grants of stock options, restricted stock units and other stock-based grants.\nThe Company issues cash settled restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights in certain countries. These grants do not result in the\nissuance of common stock and are considered immaterial by the Company.\n \nAmounts recognized in the financial statements with respect to stock-based compensation programs, which include stock options, restricted\nstock, restricted stock units, performance shares, and the General Employees’ Stock Purchase Plan (GESPP), are provided in the following\ntable. Capitalized stock-based compensation amounts were not material for the years ended 2015, 2014 and 2013.\n \nStock-Based Compensation Expense\n \n \n \nYears ended December 31\n \n(Millions)\n    \n2015\n    \n2014\n    \n2013\n \nCost of sales\n $\n46  $\n47  $\n27  \nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n  \n185   \n192   \n183  \nResearch, development and related expenses\n  \n45   \n41   \n30  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nStock-based compensation expenses\n $\n276  $\n280  $\n240  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nIncome tax benefits\n $\n(87) $\n(79) $\n(71) \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nStock-based compensation expenses, net of tax\n $\n189  $\n201  $\n169  \n \n112\n \nTable of Contents \nStock Option Program\n \nThe following table summarizes stock option activity for the years ended December 31:\n \n \n \n2015\n \n2014\n \n2013\n \n \n    \n \n    \nWeighted\n    \n \n    \nWeighted\n    \n \n    \nWeighted\n \n \n \nNumber of\n \nAverage\n \nNumber of\n \nAverage\n \nNumber of\n \nAverage\n \n \n \nOptions\n Exercise Price  \nOptions\n Exercise Price  \nOptions\n Exercise Price  \nUnder option —\n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n  \nJanuary 1\n \n39,235,557  $\n90.38  \n43,938,778  $\n83.84  \n56,565,030  $\n80.33  \nGranted:\n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n  \nAnnual\n \n5,529,544  \n \n165.91  \n5,736,183  \n \n126.77  \n6,220,810   \n101.55  \nProgressive (Reload)\n \n—  \n \n—  \n —  \n \n —  \n140,447   \n109.83  \nOther\n \n—  \n \n—  \n —  \n \n —  \n191   \n119.62  \nExercised\n \n(5,978,382) \n \n83.74  \n(10,219,261) \n \n82.37  \n(18,825,218)  \n79.25  \nCanceled\n \n(234,274) \n \n128.99  \n(220,143) \n \n105.11  \n(162,482)  \n89.92  \nDecember 31\n \n38,552,445  $\n102.01  \n39,235,557  $\n90.38  \n43,938,778  $\n83.84  \nOptions exercisable\n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n  \nDecember 31\n \n27,262,062  $\n85.97  \n27,502,208  $\n81.42  \n32,038,228  $\n79.58  \n \nStock options vest over a period from one to three years with the expiration date at 10 years from date of grant. Outstanding options under\ngrant include grants from previous plans. As of December 31, 2015, there was $69 million of compensation expense that has yet to be\nrecognized related to non-vested stock option based awards. This expense is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average\nvesting period of 21 months. For options outstanding at December 31, 2015, the weighted-average remaining contractual life was 66 months\nand the aggregate intrinsic value was $1.958 billion. For options exercisable at December 31, 2015, the weighted-average remaining\ncontractual life was 52 months and the aggregate intrinsic value was $1.763 billion.\n \nThe total intrinsic values of stock options exercised during 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $465 million, $615 million and $562 million,\nrespectively. Cash received from options exercised during 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $501 million, $842 million and $1.492 billion,\nrespectively. The Company’s actual tax benefits realized for the tax deductions related to the exercise of employee stock options for 2015,\n2014 and 2013 was $172 million, $226 million and $208 million, respectively.\n \nThe Company does not have a specific policy to repurchase common shares to mitigate the dilutive impact of options; however, the\nCompany has historically made adequate discretionary purchases, based on cash availability, market trends, and other factors, to satisfy\nstock option exercise activity.\n \nFor annual and progressive (reload) options, the weighted average fair value at the date of grant was calculated using the Black-Scholes\noption-pricing model and the assumptions that follow.

The total fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units that vested during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and\n2013 was $166 million, $145 million and $114 million, respectively.

Since the rights to dividends are forfeitable, there is no impact on basic earnings per share calculations.\nWeighted average restricted stock unit shares outstanding are included in the computation of diluted earnings per share.\n \nPerformance Shares\n \nInstead of restricted stock units, the Company makes annual grants of performance shares to members of its executive management. The\n2015 performance criteria for these performance shares (organic volume growth, return on invested capital, free cash flow conversion, and\nearnings per share growth) were selected because the Company believes that they are important drivers of long-term stockholder value. The\nnumber of shares of 3M common stock that could actually be delivered at the end of the three-year performance period may be anywhere\nfrom 0% to 200% of each performance share granted, depending on the performance of the Company during such performance period. Non-\nsubstantive vesting requires that expense for the performance shares be recognized over one or three years depending on when each\nindividual became a 3M executive. Performance shares do not accrue dividends during the performance period. Therefore, the grant date\nfair value is determined by reducing the closing stock price on the date of grant by the net present value of dividends during the performance\nperiod.\n \n114\n \nTable of Contents \nThe following table summarizes performance share activity for the years ended December 31:\n \n \n \n2015\n \n2014\n \n2013\n \n \n    \n    \n    Weighted     \n    \n    Weighted     \n    \n    Weighted  \n \n \n \n \nAverage\n \n \n \nAverage\n \n \n \nAverage\n \n \n \nNumber of\n Grant Date  \nNumber of\n Grant Date  \nNumber of\n Grant Date  \n \n \nAwards\n \nFair Value  \nAwards\n Fair Value  \nAwards\n Fair Value  \nUndistributed balance —\n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n  \nAs of January 1\n \n1,099,752  $\n102.65  \n895,635  $\n88.12  \n1,089,084  $\n79.27  \nGranted\n \n227,798  \n \n158.88  \n305,225  \n \n124.89  \n353,734   \n96.87  \nDistributed\n \n(323,938) \n \n83.08  \n(277,358) \n \n84.74  \n(507,083)  \n75.16  \nPerformance change\n \n(106,760) \n \n127.70  \n212,461  \n \n109.74  \n(6,949)  \n77.01  \nForfeited\n \n(25,660) \n \n125.33  \n(36,212) \n \n109.44  \n(33,151)  \n91.34  \nAs of December 31\n \n871,192  $\n120.89  \n1,099,752  $\n102.65  \n895,635  $\n88.12  \n \nAs of December 31, 2015, there was $17 million of compensation expense that has yet to be recognized related to performance shares.

Business Segments\n \n3M’s businesses are organized, managed and internally grouped into segments based on differences in markets, products, technologies and\nservices. 3M manages its operations in five business segments: Industrial; Safety and Graphics; Health Care; Electronics and Energy; and\nConsumer. 3M’s five business segments bring together common or related 3M technologies, enhancing the development of innovative\nproducts and services and providing for efficient sharing of business resources. Transactions among reportable segments are recorded at\ncost. 3M is an integrated enterprise characterized by substantial intersegment cooperation, cost allocations and inventory transfers.\nTherefore, management does not represent that these segments, if operated independently, would report the operating income information\nshown. The difference between operating income and pre-tax income relates to interest income and interest expense, which are not allocated\nto business segments.\n115\n \nTable of Contents \n \nEffective in the third quarter of 2015, within the Health Care business segment, the Company formed the Oral Care Solutions Division,\nwhich combined the former 3M ESPE and 3M Unitek divisions.\n \nBusiness Segment Products\n \nBusiness Segment\n    \nMajor Products\nIndustrial\n \nTapes, coated, nonwoven and bonded abrasives, adhesives, advanced ceramics, sealants, specialty\nmaterials, filtration products, closure systems for personal hygiene products, acoustic systems products,\nautomotive components, abrasion-resistant films, structural adhesives and paint finishing and detailing\nproducts\n \n \n \nSafety and Graphics\n \nPersonal protection products, traffic safety and security products, commercial graphics systems,\ncommercial cleaning and protection products, floor matting, roofing granules for asphalt shingles, and fall\nprotection products\n \n \n \nHealth Care\n \nMedical and surgical supplies, skin health and infection prevention products, drug delivery systems, dental\nand orthodontic products, health information systems and food safety products\n \n \n \nElectronics and Energy\n \nOptical films solutions for electronic displays, packaging and interconnection devices, insulating and\nsplicing solutions for the electronics, telecommunications and electrical industries, touch screens and\ntouch monitors, renewable energy component solutions, and infrastructure protection products\n \n \n \nConsumer\n \nSponges, scouring pads, high-performance cloths, consumer and office tapes, repositionable notes,\nindexing systems, construction and home improvement products, home care products, protective material\nproducts, and consumer and office tapes and adhesives\n \nBusiness Segment Information\n \n \n \nNet Sales\n \nOperating Income\n \n(Millions)\n    \n2015\n    \n2014\n    \n2013\n    \n2015\n    \n2014\n    \n2013\n \nIndustrial\n $\n10,328  $\n10,990  $\n10,657  $\n2,263  $\n2,389  $\n2,307  \nSafety and Graphics\n  \n5,515   \n5,732   \n5,584   \n1,305   \n1,296   \n1,227  \nHealth Care\n  \n5,420   \n5,572   \n5,334   \n1,724   \n1,724   \n1,672  \nElectronics and Energy\n  \n5,220   \n5,604   \n5,393   \n1,102   \n1,115   \n954  \nConsumer\n  \n4,422   \n4,523   \n4,435   \n1,046   \n995   \n945  \nCorporate and Unallocated\n  \n1   \n4   \n8   \n(355)  \n(251)  \n(321) \nElimination of Dual Credit\n  \n(632)  \n(604)  \n(540)  \n(139)  \n(133)  \n(118) \nTotal Company\n $\n30,274  $\n31,821  $\n30,871  $\n6,946  $\n7,135  $\n6,666  \n \n \n \nAssets\n \nDepreciation & Amortization\n \nCapital Expenditures\n \n(Millions)\n    \n2015\n    \n2014\n    \n2013\n    \n2015\n    \n2014\n    \n2013\n    \n2015\n    \n2014\n    \n2013\n \nIndustrial\n $\n9,203  $\n8,508  $\n8,833  $\n374  $\n383  $\n373  $\n317  $\n395  $\n511  \nSafety and Graphics\n  \n7,564   \n4,939   \n5,122   \n245  \n \n234  \n \n255   \n199   \n221   \n207  \nHealth Care\n  \n4,403   \n4,344   \n4,329   \n179  \n \n181  \n \n171   \n168   \n169   \n120  \nElectronics and Energy\n  \n4,815   \n5,116   \n5,336   \n291  \n \n271  \n \n260   \n211   \n232   \n261  \nConsumer\n  \n2,393   \n2,434   \n2,516   \n108  \n \n108  \n \n106   \n124   \n111   \n128  \nCorporate and Unallocated\n  \n4,340   \n5,868   \n7,168   \n238  \n \n231  \n \n206   \n442   \n365   \n438  \nTotal Company\n $ 32,718  $ 31,209  $ 33,304  $\n1,435  $\n1,408  $\n1,371  $ 1,461  $ 1,493  $\n1,665  \n \nCorporate and unallocated operating income includes a variety of miscellaneous items, such as corporate investment gains and losses,\ncertain derivative gains and losses, certain insurance-related gains and losses, certain litigation and environmental expenses, corporate\nrestructuring charges and certain under- or over-absorbed costs (e.g. pension, stock-based compensation) that the Company may choose not\nto allocate directly to its business segments. Because this category includes a variety of miscellaneous items, it is subject to fluctuation on a\nquarterly and annual basis.\n \n116\n \nTable of Contents \n3M business segment reporting measures include dual credit to business segments for certain U.S. sales and related operating income.\nManagement evaluates each of its five business segments based on net sales and operating income performance, including dual credit U.S.\nreporting to further incentivize U.S. sales growth. As a result, 3M provides additional (“dual”) credit to those business segments selling\nproducts in the U.S. to an external customer when that segment is not the primary seller of the product. For example, certain respirators are\nprimarily sold by the Personal Safety Division within the Safety and Graphics business segment; however, the Industrial business segment\nalso sells this product to certain customers in its U.S. markets.

In this example, the non-primary selling segment (Industrial) would also\nreceive credit for the associated net sales it initiated and the related approximate operating income. The assigned operating income related to\ndual credit activity may differ from operating income that would result from actual costs associated with such sales. The offset to the dual\ncredit business segment reporting is reflected as a reconciling item entitled “Elimination of Dual Credit,” such that sales and operating\nincome for the U.S. in total are unchanged.\n \n NOTE 17.

The Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including the Chief\nExecutive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s “disclosure controls and\nprocedures” (as defined in the Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation,\nthe Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective.\n \nb. The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial\nreporting, as defined in the Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Management conducted an assessment of the Company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting based on the framework established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in\nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013). Based on the assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2015, the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting is effective. Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 excluded Capital Safety Group S.A.R.L. and Polypore International, Inc.’s\nSeparation Media Business, which were both acquired by the Company in August 2015 in purchase business combinations. These acquired\nbusinesses’ total assets and total net sales, in the aggregate, represented less than 2 percent and less than 1 percent, respectively, of the\nCompany’s consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015. Companies are allowed to exclude\nacquisitions from their assessment of internal control over financial reporting during the first year of acquisition while integrating the\nacquired company under guidelines established by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company’s internal control over financial\nreporting as of December 31, 2015 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as\nstated in their report which is included herein, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015.\n \nc. There was no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company’s most recently\ncompleted fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting.\n \nThe Company is implementing an enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system on a worldwide basis, which is expected to improve the\nefficiency of certain financial and related transaction processes. The gradual implementation is expected to occur in phases over the next\nseveral years. The implementation of a worldwide ERP system will likely affect the processes that constitute our internal control over\nfinancial reporting and will require testing for effectiveness.\n \nThe Company completed implementation with respect to elements of certain processes/sub-processes in limited subsidiaries/locations and\nwill continue to roll-out the ERP system over the next several years. As with any new information technology application we implement,\nthis application, along with the internal controls over financial reporting included in this process, was appropriately considered within the\ntesting for effectiveness with respect to the implementation in these instances. We concluded, as part of our evaluation described in the\nabove paragraphs, that the implementation of ERP in these circumstances has not materially affected our internal control over financial\nreporting.\n \nItem 9B.

The Committee may also,\nin its sole discretion, shorten or terminate the Restricted Period or waive any terms or conditions for the lapse of restrictions with respect to\nall or any portion of the shares of Common Stock represented by the Restricted Stock.  During the Restricted Period the Participant shall\ngenerally have the rights and privileges of a stockholder as to such Restricted Stock, including the right to vote such Restricted Stock and\nreceive dividend payments, except that the following restrictions shall apply: (i) none of the Restricted Stock may be sold, transferred,\nassigned, pledged, or otherwise encumbered or disposed of during the Restricted Period and until the satisfaction of any other terms and\nconditions prescribed by the Committee, if any; and (ii) all of the Restricted Stock shall be forfeited and all rights of the Participant shall\nterminate without further obligation on the part of the Company unless the Participant shall have remained a regular full-time employee of\nthe Company or an Affiliate until the expiration or termination of the Restricted Period and the satisfaction of the other terms and conditions\nprescribed by the Committee, if any.  Any Restricted Stock granted under the Plan may be evidenced in such manner as the Committee may\ndetermine, in its discretion, including, without limitation, book-entry registration or issuance of one or more stock certificates bearing an\nappropriate legend recognizing the terms, conditions and restrictions applicable to such Restricted Stock.  Upon the forfeiture of any\nRestricted Stock, such shares of Common Stock represented by the Restricted Stock shall be transferred to the Company without further\naction by the Participant.\n \n(f)\nRestricted Stock Units - At the time a grant of Restricted Stock Units is made, the Committee, in its sole discretion,\nshall establish a Restricted Period and such additional terms and conditions as may be deemed appropriate for the incremental lapse or\ncomplete lapse of restrictions with respect to all or any portion of such Restricted Stock Units.  The Committee may also, in its sole\ndiscretion, shorten or terminate the Restricted Period or waive any terms or conditions for the lapse of restrictions with respect to all or any\nportion of the Restricted Stock Units.  During the Restricted Period the Participant will not have the rights and privileges of a stockholder as\nto such Restricted Stock Units, including the right to vote and receive dividend payments with respect to the shares of Common Stock\ncorresponding to such Restricted Stock Units; provided, however, that at the sole discretion of the Committee, Dividend Equivalents may be\neither currently paid in cash or shares or withheld by the Company for the Participant’s account and\n5\n \n \n \neither maintained in cash to be paid upon the expiration of the Restricted Period or reinvested in additional Restricted Stock Units.  Each\ngrant of Restricted Stock Units shall be subject to the following restrictions: (i) the Participant shall not be entitled to the payment of cash or\nthe delivery of the shares of Common Stock corresponding to such Restricted Stock Units until the expiration or termination of the\nRestricted Period and the satisfaction of any other terms and conditions prescribed by the Committee, if any; (ii) none of the Restricted\nStock Units may be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged, or otherwise encumbered or disposed of at any time; and (iii) except as otherwise\nprovided in Section 7, all of the Restricted Stock Units and any deferred Dividend Equivalents shall be forfeited and all rights of the\nParticipant shall terminate without further obligation on the part of the Company upon the termination of the Participant’s employment with\nthe Company or an Affiliate prior to the end of the Restricted Period; provided, however, that if the Committee so decides and the\ndocuments evidencing an Award of Restricted Stock Units so provide, the preceding exception allowing such Restricted Stock Units to vest\nfollowing the Participant’s Retirement shall not apply so that such Restricted Stock Units and any deferred Dividend Equivalents will be\nforfeited and all rights of the Participant shall terminate without further obligation on the part of the Company upon the Retirement of such\nParticipant prior to the end of the Restricted Period.\n \n(g)\nOther Stock Awards - The Committee may, in its sole discretion, grant Stock Awards other than Restricted Stock\ngrants or Restricted Stock Units, and such Stock Awards may be granted singly, in combination or in tandem with, in replacement of, or as\nalternatives to grants or rights under this Plan or any other employee benefit or compensation plan of the Company, including the plan of\nany acquired entity.  If the Committee shall stipulate terms and conditions with respect to such Stock Awards, the terms and conditions will\nbe set forth in the documents evidencing the Award.  If the terms and conditions with respect to any Stock Award shall require the surrender\nor forfeiture of other grants or rights under this Plan or any other employee benefit or compensation plan of the Company, then the\nParticipant shall not have any rights under such Stock Award until the grants or rights exchanged have been fully and effectively\nsurrendered or forfeited.\n \n(h)\nPerformance Units and Performance Shares – At the time it approves each grant of Performance Units or Performance\nShares, the Committee shall determine the number of Performance Units or Performance Shares granted to each Participant, the proration, if\nany, of such Performance Units or Performance Shares if the Participant retires prior to the completion of the relevant Performance Period,\nthe commencement and expiration of the relevant Performance Period, and the Performance Criteria by which the payment value of the\nPerformance Units or Performance Shares will be determined.  If the Committee provides, a grant of Performance Units or Performance\nShares may provide a Participant with the right to receive Dividend Equivalents, subject to the same restrictions on transferability and\nforfeitability and payable at the same time as the Performance Units or Performance Shares with respect to which the Dividend Equivalents\nare granted.  Any such Dividend Equivalents shall be converted to cash or additional shares of Common Stock, or a combination of cash and\nshares of Common Stock, by such formula and at such time and subject to such limitations as may be set forth in the written agreement\nevidencing the award.  Payment of each Performance Unit and Performance Share shall occur no later than the March 15 of the year\nimmediately following the completion of the respective Performance Period, unless a Participant shall have made an effective election to\ndefer the receipt of such payment pursuant to the terms of an applicable deferred compensation plan and all applicable laws.  The amount\npayable with respect to each Performance Unit and Performance Share shall be contingent upon the attainment of the Performance Criteria\nselected by the Committee during the respective Performance Period, and upon the continued employment of the Participant throughout\nsuch Performance Period (or upon the Participant’s Retirement prior to the end of such Performance Period).\n \n6.\nPayment of Awards.\n \nPayment of Awards may be in the form of cash, s\n\n--------------------------------\nAnd here is your task:\n\nExtract the exact total revenue (or net sales) figure for 2014 in billions of dollars.

Each grant of Restricted Stock Units shall be subject to the\nfollowing restrictions: (i) the Participant shall not be entitled to delivery of the shares of Common Stock corresponding to such Restricted\nStock Units until the expiration or termination of the Restricted Period and the satisfaction of any other Conditions prescribed by the\nCommittee, if any; (ii) none of the Restricted Stock Units may be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged, or otherwise encumbered or disposed\nof during the Restricted Period and until the satisfaction of other Conditions prescribed by the Committee, if any; and (iii) all of the\nRestricted Stock Units shall be forfeited and all rights of the Participant shall terminate without further obligation on the part of the\nCompany unless the Participant shall have remained a regular full-time employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates\nuntil the expiration or termination of the Restricted Period and the satisfaction of the other Conditions prescribed by the Committee, if any.\n \n(g)\nOther Stock Awards - The Committee may, in its sole discretion, grant Stock Awards other than Restricted Stock\ngrants or Restricted Stock Units, and such Stock Awards may be granted singly, in combination or in tandem with, in replacement of, or as\nalternatives to grants or rights under this Program or any other employee benefit or compensation plan of the Company, including the plan\nof any acquired entity.  If the Committee shall stipulate Conditions with respect to such Stock Awards, the Conditions will be set forth in\ndocuments evidencing the grant.  If Conditions with respect to such Stock Awards shall require the surrender or forfeiture of other grants or\nrights under this Program or any other employee benefit or compensation plan of the Company, then the Participant shall not have any\nrights under such Stock Awards until the grants or rights exchanged have been fully and effectively surrendered or forfeited.\n \nSECTION 7  SETTLEMENT OF AWARDS\n(a)\nPayment of Awards may be in the form of cash, Common Stock or combinations thereof as the Committee shall\ndetermine, and with such other restrictions as it may impose.  The Committee may also require or permit Participants to elect to defer the\nissuance of shares or the settlement of Awards in cash under such rules and procedures as it may establish under the 2005 Program.  It may\nalso provide that deferred settlements include the payment or crediting of interest on the deferral amounts denominated in cash or the\npayment or crediting of Dividend Equivalents on deferred settlements denominated in shares.\n \n(b)\n No shares of Common Stock shall be issued to any Participant upon the exercise of an Option until full payment of the\npurchase price has been made to the Company and the Participant has remitted to the Company the required federal and state withholding\ntaxes, if any.  A Participant shall obtain no rights as a stockholder until certificates for such stock are issued to the Participant or delivered to\nthe MSOP Administrator for credit to the account of the Participant.  Payment of the purchase price or applicable withholding taxes, if any,\nmay be made in whole, or in part, in shares of Common Stock, pursuant to such terms and conditions as may be established from time to\ntime by the Committee.  If payment is made in shares of Common Stock, such stock shall be valued at one hundred percent (100%) of their\nFair Market Value on the day the Participant exercised his or her Option or, as regards a withholding tax, such other date when the tax\nwithholding obligation becomes due.  A Participant need not surrender shares of Common Stock as payment; and the Company may, upon\nthe giving of satisfactory evidence of ownership of said Common Stock by Participant, deliver the appropriate number of additional shares\nof Common Stock reduced by the number of shares required to pay the purchase price and any applicable withholding taxes.  Such form of\nevidence shall be determined by the Committee.\n \nSECTION 8  DELIVERY OF STOCK CERTIFICATES\n \n(a)\nWithin sixty (60) days after completion of the exercise of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right, or the complete\nsatisfaction of Conditions applicable to a Stock Award, the Company will have delivered to the Participant or to the MSOP Administrator\nfo\n\n--------------------------------\nAnd here is your task:\n\nExtract the exact total revenue (or net sales) figure for 2014 in billions of dollars.

The\nCommittee may, in its sole discretion, create further conditions and requirements for the transfer of Nonqualified Options.  Following\ntransfer, any such Nonqualified Options shall continue to be subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable immediately prior\nto transfer, provided that for purposes of Sections 7, 8 and 14 hereof the term “Participant” shall be deemed to refer to the transferee.

At the conclusion of such ninety-day period (with respect to the Participant’s Options and Stock Appreciation\nRights, and at the time of termination with respect to any other Awards), participation hereunder shall cease and all of the Participant’s\nAwards granted under this 2005 Program shall be automatically forfeited unless the documents evidencing such Options or Stock\nAppreciation Rights provide otherwise.\n \n6\n \n \n(b)\nIf a Participant Retires, terminates employment with the Company and in connection with such termination the Participant\nexecutes a written release of employment-related claims in favor of the Company that provides (with the approval of the Company) for the\nnonforfeiture of Options and Stock Appreciation Rights, or changes employment status as a result of a physical or mental disability as\nrecognized under a benefit plan maintained by the Company, without having fully exercised an Option or Stock Appreciation Right, the\nParticipant shall be entitled, within the remaining term of the Option or Stock Appreciation Right (but not beyond the expiration date of\nsuch Option or Right), to exercise such Option or Stock Appreciation Right (provided, however, that in the event of a termination in\nconnection with which the Participant executes a written release of employment-related claims in favor of the Company that provides (with\nthe approval of the Company) for the nonforfeiture of Options and Stock Appreciation Rights, the additional time to exercise Options and\nStock Appreciation Rights shall apply only to those Options and Stock Appreciation Rights which have vested prior to the date of\ntermination of employment).

Note 1 to the financial statements describes a change in\naccounting principle from a method which classifies marketable securities on the consolidated balance sheet based on management’s\nintended holding period to a method which classifies marketable securities based on the nature of the securities and their availability\nfor use in current operations.  It should be understood that the preferability of one acceptable method of accounting over another for the\nclassification of marketable securities has not been addressed in any authoritative accounting literature, and in expressing our\nconcurrence below we have relied on management’s determination that this change in accounting principle is preferable.  Based on our\nreading of management’s stated reasons and justification for this change in accounting principle in the Form 10-K, and our discussions\nwith management as to their judgment about the relevant business planning factors relating to the change, we concur with management\nthat such change represents, in the Company’s circumstances, the adoption of a preferable accounting principle in conformity with\nAccounting Standards Codification 250, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections.\n \nVery truly yours,\n \n \n \n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\n \n EXHIBIT 21\n \n3M COMPANY AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES (PARENT AND SUBSIDIARIES)\nAS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015\n \nName of Company\n \nOrganized Under Law of\nRegistrant — 3M Company\n \nDelaware\nConsolidated subsidiaries of the Registrant:\n \n \n3M Cogent, Inc.\n \nDelaware\n3M Electronic Monitoring, Inc.\n \nDelaware\n3M Financial Management Company\n \nDelaware\n3M Global Channel Services, Inc.\n \nDelaware\n3M Innovative Properties Company\n \nDelaware\n3M Investment Management Corporation\n \nDelaware\n3M Occupational Safety LLC\n \nDelaware\n3M Purification Inc.\n \nDelaware\nAearo Holding LLC\n \nDelaware\nAearo Technologies LLC\n \nDelaware\nCapital Safety North America Holdings, Inc.\n \nDelaware\nCeradyne, Inc.\n \nDelaware\n3M Unitek Corporation\n \nCalifornia\nIvera Medical LLC\n \nCalifornia\nMeguiar’s, Inc.\n \nCalifornia\n3M Health Information Systems, Inc.\n \nMaryland\n3M Touch Systems, Inc.\n \nMassachusetts\nGTA-NHT, Inc.\n \nMassachusetts\nDB Industries LLC\n \nMinnesota\nTwo Harbors Insurance Company\n \nSouth Carolina\n3M Argentina S.A.C.I.F.I.A\n \nArgentina\n3M Australia Pty.

The estimated fair values for these reporting units were in excess of carrying\nvalue by approximately 50 percent or more, except for one reporting unit with approximately $300 million of goodwill, where the fair value\nexceeded the carrying value by approximately 30 percent. 3M’s market value at both September 30, 2015, and December 31, 2015, was\nsignificantly in excess of its equity of approximately $12 billion at both December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015.\n \nIn 2015, 3M primarily used an industry price-earnings ratio approach, but also used a discounted cash flows approach for certain reporting\nunits, to determine fair values. Where applicable, 3M used a weighted-average discounted cash flow analysis for certain divisions, using\nprojected cash flows that were weighted based on different sales growth and terminal value assumptions, among other factors. The\nweighting was based on management’s estimates of the likelihood of each scenario occurring.\n \n3M is an integrated materials enterprise, thus many of 3M’s businesses could not easily be sold on a stand-alone basis. 3M’s focus on\nresearch and development has resulted in a portion of 3M’s value being comprised of internally developed businesses that have no goodwill\nassociated with them. Based on the annual test in the fourth quarter of 2015, no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting\nunits.\n \nFactors which could result in future impairment charges include, among others, changes in worldwide economic conditions, changes in\ncompetitive conditions and customer preferences, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. These risk factors are discussed in\nItem 1A, “Risk Factors,” of this document. In addition, changes in the weighted average cost of capital could also impact impairment testing\nresults. As indicated above, during the third quarter of 2015, the Company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment\nfor reporting units impacted by changes between reporting units and determined that no impairment existed. Long-lived assets with a\ndefinite life are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset\ngroup) may not be recoverable. If future non-cash asset impairment charges are taken, 3M would expect that only a portion of the long-lived\nassets or goodwill would be impaired. 3M will continue to monitor its reporting units and asset groups in 2016 for any triggering events or\nother indicators of impairment.\n \nIncome Taxes:\n \nThe extent of 3M’s operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude\nof jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions\nand resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. The Company recognizes potential liabilities and records\ntax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether, and the extent\nto which, additional taxes will be due. The Company follows guidance provided by ASC 740, Income Taxes, regarding uncertainty in\nincome taxes, to record these liabilities (refer to Note 8 for additional information). The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing\nfacts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that\nis materially different from the Company’s current estimate of the tax liabilities. If the Company’s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be\nless than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less\nthan the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the Company\ndetermines the liabilities are no longer necessary.\n \nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\n \nInformation regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n \n37\n \nTable of Contents \nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY\n \n3M continues its transition to a better-optimized capital structure and is adding leverage at a measured pace. The strength and stability of\n3M\'s business model and strong free cash flow capability, together with proven capital markets access, enable the Company to implement\nthis strategy. Investing in 3M’s businesses to drive organic growth remains the first priority, thus 3M will continue to deploy capital towards\nresearch and development, capital expenditures, and commercialization capability. Investment in organic growth will be supplemented by\ncomplementary acquisitions. 3M will also continue to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Sources for cash\navailability in the United States, such as ongoing cash flow from operations and access to capital markets, have historically been sufficient\nto fund dividend payments to shareholders and share repurchases, as well as funding U.S. acquisitions and other items as needed. For those\ninternational earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely, the Company currently has no plans or intentions to repatriate these funds for\nU.S. operations. However, if these international funds are needed for operations in the U.S., 3M would be required to accrue and pay U.S.\ntaxes to repatriate them. See Note 8 for further information on earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely.\n \n3M’s primary short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand and U.S. commercial paper issuances. The Company believes it will\nhave continuous access to the commercial paper market. 3M’s commercial paper program permits the Company to have a maximum of $3\nbillion outstanding with a maximum maturity of 397 days from date of issuance.\n \nNet Debt:\n \nThe Company defines net debt as total debt less the total of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. 3M considers net debt and its\ncomponents to be an important indicator of liquidity and a guiding measure of capital structure strategy. Net debt is not defined under U.S.\ngenerally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. The\nfollowing table provides net debt as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.\n \nAt December 31\n        \n \n        \n \n \n(Millions)\n \n2015\n \n2014\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \nTotal Debt\n $\n10,797  $\n6,811  \nLess: Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities\n \n \n1,925  \n \n3,351  \nNet Debt\n $\n8,872  $\n3,460  \n \nIn 2015, net debt rose by $5.4 billion to a net debt balance of $8.9 billion (as of December 31, 2015), as 3M progressed on its capital\nstructure strategy. Debt levels were higher in both the U.S. and internationally, while international cash and marketable securities balances\nwere reduced. Specific actions related to cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, in addition to debt, are discussed further below.\n \nCash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities:\n \nAt December 31, 2015, 3M had $1.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which approximately $1.7 billion was\nheld by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries and $200 million was held by the United States. Of the $1.7 billion held internationally, U.S.\ndollar-based cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $355 million, or 21 percent, which was invested in money market\nfunds, asset-backed securities, agency securities, corporate medium-term note securities and other high quality fixed income securities. At\nDecember 31, 2014, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries and in the United States\ntotaled approximately $3.3 billion and less than $100 million, respectively.\n \nThe Company’s total balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was $1.4 billion lower at December 31, 2015 when\ncompared to December 31, 2014. 3M was able to manage the business with lower cash levels due to significant ongoing cash flow\ngeneration and proven access to capital markets funding throughout business cycles.\n \n38\n \nTable of Contents \nTotal Debt:\n \nThe Company’s total debt was $4.0 billion higher at December 31, 2015 when compared to December 31, 2014. The strength of 3M’s\ncapital structure and significant ongoing cash flows provide 3M proven access to capital markets. Additionally, the Company’s maturity\nprofile is staggered to help ensure refinancing needs in any given year are reasonable in proportion to the total portfolio. The Company has\nan AA- credit rating, with a stable outlook, from Standard & Poor’s and an Aa3 credit rating, with a negative outlook, from Moody’s\nInvestors Service. The Company’s ongoing transition to a better-optimized capital structure, financed with additional low-cost debt, could\nimpact 3M’s credit rating in the future.\n \nEffective May 16, 2014, the Company updated its “well-known seasoned issuer” shelf registration statement, which registers an\nindeterminate amount of debt or equity securities for future sales. This replaced 3M’s previous shelf registration dated August 5, 2011. In\nJune 2014, in connection with the May 16, 2014 shelf registration, 3M re-commenced its medium-term notes program (Series F) under\nwhich 3M may issue, from time to time, up to $9 billion aggregate principal amount of notes. Included in this $9 billion are $8.17 billion\n(utilizing the foreign exchange rate applicable at the time of issuance for the Euro denominated debt) of notes previously issued in 2011,\n2012, 2014, and 2015 as part of Series F. Information with respect to long-term debt issuances and maturities for the periods presented is\nincluded in Note 10.\n \nIn August 2014, 3M amend\n\n"""\n\n# Searching for \'2014\' and \'Net Sales\' or \'Total Revenue\'\nif "2014" in text and ("Net Sales" in text or "Total Revenue" in text):\n  # Extracting the relevant text\n  relevant_text = text.split("2014")[1].split("Net")[0]\n  # Extracting the numeric value\n  answer = relevant_text.split("$")[1].split(" ")[0]\n  # Converting the answer to a numeric value\n  answer = float(answer)\n  # Formatting the answer as a numeric value\n  answer = "{:.1f}".format(answer)\n  # Creating the JobOutput object\n  job_output = JobOutput(\n    explanation="The total revenue figure for 2014 is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text.

See\nNote 5 “Supplemental Balance Sheet Information” for further details.\n \nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company had tax effected operating losses, capital losses, and tax credit carryovers for federal\n(approximately $31 million), state (approximately $2 million), and international (approximately $76 million), with all amounts before\nvaluation allowances. The federal tax attribute carryovers will expire after 15 to 20 years, the state after five to 10 years, and the majority of\ninternational after four years with the remaining international expiring in one year or with an indefinite carryover period. The tax attributes\nbeing carried over arise as certain jurisdictions may have tax losses or may have inabilities to utilize certain losses without the same type of\ntaxable income. As of December 31, 2015, the Company has provided $31 million of valuation allowance against certain of these deferred\ntax assets based on management’s determination that it is more-likely-than-not that the tax benefits related to these assets will not be\nrealized.\n \n74\n \nTable of Contents \nReconciliation of Effective Income Tax Rate\n \n \n    \n2015\n    \n2014\n    \n2013\n \nStatutory U.S. tax rate\n \n35.0 %  \n35.0 %  \n35.0 %\nState income taxes - net of federal benefit\n \n1.1  \n0.9  \n0.9  \nInternational income taxes - net\n \n(3.8) \n(5.8) \n(6.3) \nU.S. research and development credit\n \n(0.5) \n(0.4) \n(0.7) \nReserves for tax contingencies\n \n(1.0) \n0.6  \n1.2  \nDomestic Manufacturer’s deduction\n \n(1.8) \n(1.3) \n(1.6) \nAll other - net\n \n0.1  \n(0.1) \n(0.4) \nEffective worldwide tax rate\n \n29.1 %  \n28.9 %  \n28.1 %\n \nThe effective tax rate for 2015 was 29.1 percent, compared to 28.9 percent in 2014, an increase of 0.2 percentage points, impacted by several\nfactors. Factors which increased the Company’s effective tax rate included international taxes, which were impacted by changes in foreign\ncurrency rates and changes to the geographic mix of income before taxes, and other items. Combined, these factors increased the\nCompany’s effective tax rate by 2.4 percentage points. This increase was partially offset by a 2.2 percentage point decrease, which related to\nthe remeasurements of 3M’s uncertain tax positions, including the restoration of tax basis on certain assets for which depreciation\ndeductions were previously limited, and increases in the domestic manufacturer’s deduction and U.S. research and development credit\nbenefits.\n \nThe effective tax rate for 2014 was 28.9 percent, compared to 28.1 percent in 2013, an increase of 0.8 percentage points, impacted by many\nfactors. Factors which increased the Company’s effective tax rate included a one-time international tax impact related to the establishment\nof the supply chain center of expertise in Europe, decreased U.S. research and development credit in 2014 compared to 2013 due to two\nyears inclusion as a result of the reinstatement in 2013, decreased domestic manufacturer’s deduction, and other items. Combined, these\nfactors increased the Company’s effective tax rate by 1.6 percentage points. This increase was partially offset by a 0.8 percentage point\ndecrease, which related to both lower 3M income tax reserves for 2014 when compared to 2013 and international taxes as a result of changes\nto the geographic mix of income before taxes.\n \nThe Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various states and foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the\nCompany is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2005.\n \nThe IRS has completed its field examination of the Company’s U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 2005 through 2013. The\nCompany protested certain IRS positions within these tax years and entered into the administrative appeals process with the IRS. In\nDecember 2012, the Company received a statutory notice of deficiency for the 2006 year. The Company filed a petition in Tax Court in the\nfirst quarter of 2013 relating to the 2006 tax year. Currently, the Company is under examination by the IRS for its U.S. federal income tax\nreturns for the years 2014 and 2015. It is anticipated that the IRS will complete its examination of the Company for 2014 by the end of the\nfirst quarter of 2016 and for 2015 by the end of the first quarter of 2017. As of December 31, 2015, the IRS has not proposed any significant\nadjustments to the Company’s tax positions for which the Company is not adequately reserved.\n \nPayments relating to other proposed assessments arising from the 2005 through 2015 examinations may not be made until a final agreement\nis reached between the Company and the IRS on such assessments or upon a final resolution resulting from the administrative appeals\nprocess or judicial action.

The ending net UTB results from adjusting the gross balance for items such\nas Federal, State, and non-U.S. deferred items, interest and penalties, and deductible taxes. The net UTB is included as components of Other\nAssets, Accrued Income Taxes, and Other Liabilities within the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in tax expense. The Company recognized in the\nconsolidated statement of income on a gross basis approximately $2 million of expense, $14 million of benefit, and $22 million of expense\nin 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. The amount of interest and penalties recognized may be an expense or benefit due to new or\nremeasured unrecognized tax benefit accruals. At December 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014, accrued interest and penalties in the\nconsolidated balance sheet on a gross basis were $45 million and $44 million, respectively. Included in these interest and penalty amounts\nare interest and penalties related to tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about\nthe timing of such deductibility. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting, other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of the\nshorter deductibility period would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority to\nan earlier period.\n\nAs a result of certain employment commitments and capital investments made by 3M, income from certain manufacturing activities in the\nfollowing countries is subject to reduced tax rates or, in some cases, is exempt from tax for years through the following: Taiwan (2015),\nChina (2016), Korea (2018), Brazil (2023), Switzerland (2024), and Singapore (2025). The income tax benefits attributable to the tax status\nof these subsidiaries are estimated to be $114 million (18 cents per diluted share) in 2015, $99 million (15 cents per diluted share) in 2014,\nand $87 million (13 cents per diluted share) in 2013.\n\nThe Company has not provided deferred taxes on unremitted earnings attributable to international companies that have been considered to\nbe reinvested indefinitely, with the exception of an acquired entity. These earnings relate to ongoing operations and were approximately $12\nbillion as of December 31, 2015. Because of the availability of U.S. foreign tax credits, the multiple avenues in which to repatriate the\nearnings to minimize tax cost, and because a large portion of these earnings are not liquid, it is not practical to determine the income tax\nliability that would be payable if such earnings were not reinvested indefinitely.\n\n76\n\nTable of Contents\n\nNOTE 9.

At December 31, 2015 and 2014, gross unrealized gains and/or losses (pre-tax) were not material. Refer to Note 6 for a table that\nprovides the net realized gains (losses) related to sales or impairments of debt and equity securities, which includes marketable securities.\nThe gross amounts of the realized gains or losses were not material. Cost of securities sold use the first in, first out (FIFO) method. Since\nthese marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale securities, changes in fair value will flow through other comprehensive\nincome, with amounts reclassified out of other comprehensive income into earnings upon sale or “other-than-temporary” impairment.\n\n3M reviews impairments associated with its marketable securities in accordance with the measurement guidance provided by ASC\n320, Investments-Debt and Equity Securities, when determining the classification of the impairment as “temporary” or “other-than-\ntemporary”. A temporary impairment charge results in an unrealized loss being recorded in the other comprehensive income component of\nshareholders’ equity. Such an unrealized loss does not reduce net income attributable to 3M for the applicable accounting period because the\nloss is not viewed as other-than-temporary. The factors evaluated to differentiate between temporary and other-than-temporary include the\nprojected future cash flows, credit ratings actions, and assessment of the credit quality of the underlying collateral, as well as other factors.\n\n77\n\nTable of Contents \nThe balance at December 31, 2015, for marketable securities by contractual maturity are shown below. Actual maturities may differ from\ncontractual maturities because the issuers of the securities may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties.\n\n(Millions)\n    \nDecember 31, 2015\n \n \n \n \n  \nDue in one year or less\n \n$\n52  \nDue after one year through five years\n \n \n74  \nDue after five years through ten years\n \n \n1  \nDue after ten years\n \n \n —  \nTotal marketable securities\n \n$\n127  \n \n3M has a diversified marketable securities portfolio of $127 million as of December 31, 2015. Within this portfolio, current asset-backed\nsecurities (estimated fair value of $57 million) primarily include interests in automobile loans, credit cards and equipment leases. 3M’s\ninvestment policy allows investments in asset-backed securities with minimum credit ratings of Aa2 by Moody’s Investors Service or AA\nby Standard & Poor’s or Fitch Ratings or DBRS. Asset-backed securities must be rated by at least two of the aforementioned rating\nagencies, one of which must be Moody’s Investors Service or Standard & Poor’s. At December 31, 2015, all asset-backed security\ninvestments were in compliance with this policy. Approximately 75.8 percent of all asset-backed security investments were rated AAA or A-\n1+ by Standard & Poor’s and/or Aaa or P-1 by Moody’s Investors Service and/or AAA or F1+ by Fitch Ratings. Interest rate risk and credit\nrisk related to the underlying collateral may impact the value of investments in asset-backed securities, while factors such as general\nconditions in the overall credit market and the nature of the underlying collateral may affect the liquidity of investments in asset-backed\nsecurities. 3M does not currently expect risk related to its holding in asset-backed securities to materially impact its financial condition or\nliquidity.\n\n78\n\nTable of Contents \nNOTE 10.
